    "question": "who is freddy krueger?",
    "response": "Freddy Krueger is the main antagonist in the A Nightmare on Elm Street horror franchise, particularly highlighted in the 2010 reboot. Originally, he was a human groundskeeper at a preschool who was secretly a child molester, preying on young children in his community. After being discovered and killed by the parents of his victims in a vigilante act, Freddy transformed into a vengeful supernatural entity known as a \"Dream Demon.\" This allows him to invade people's dreams and kill them in ways that manifest real-world injuries, seeking revenge on the teenagers he blames for his demise.\n\nIn the series, Freddy is significant as a horror trope representing the \"undead slasher\" archetype— a once-human monster who embodies repressed fears and societal guilt. Unlike some portrayals, the reboot version is more serious and realistic, focusing on his burned appearance and psychological terror rather than humor. This character explores themes like the inescapability of past sins and the power of the subconscious, making him a key figure for analyzing horror storytelling. If you'd like to dive deeper into his powers, victims, or comparisons to other versions, let me know!",

In this film, Freddy appeared once again as a Dream Demon and a serial killer after his death.\n  \n\n   In life, he was a child molester. It isn't stated in the film whether or not he'd killed anybody when he was alive.\n  \n\n   After death, he killed the majority of the teenage children who he blames for his death in their nightmares, but\n   \n    Nancy Holbrook\n   \n   and\n   \n    Quentin Smith\n   \n   survived.\n  \n\n   Unlike the\n   \n    original Freddy Krueger\n   \n   , who, over the course of the series, developed a cheeky and dark humored personality and always cracked puns and jokes when he killed his victims, the reboot version of Freddy seemed to be more in line with how\n   \n    Wes Craven\n   \n   had originally envisioned the character; a much more serious killer.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Biography\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Characterization\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.1\n        \n\n         Powers and abilities\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.2\n        \n\n         Weaknesses\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.3\n        \n\n         Appearance\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Quotes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       List of confirmed human molestation victims of Freddy Krueger\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       List of confirmed human murder victims of Freddy Krueger\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       Animal victims\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       10\n      \n\n       Sources\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Biography\n   \n\n\n   Freddy Krueger was the Groundskeeper at\n   \n    Badham Preschool\n   \n   , a pedophile and child molester, and he had a more personal connection with the protagonist,\n   \n    Nancy Holbrook\n   \n   , as he molested her and the other preschoolers and she was his favorite. Freddy initially appeared to have been wrongly accused and seemingly looked like a friendly gardener around the children. The parents, after they heard about the abuse from their children and observed slashes on their skin and clothes that were consistent with his\n   \n    trademark glove\n   \n   , chased Freddy down to a building, in which Freddy locked himself in. One of the parents threw in a container of gasoline with a burning rag. It is implied that he did this to force him to come out, not to intentionally burn him to death. However, he did end up burning him to death. The parents did that to spare their children the trauma of having to testify against him in open court.\n  \n\n   Having been burned to death, Freddy somehow returned as a vengeful Dream Demon who killed off the teenage children in their dreams one by one as payback against the parents for killing him and/or as payback against them for reporting his actions to their parents.\n  \n\n   During the climax, Nancy pulled Freddy into the physical world and apparently killed him by severing his gloved-hand and slashed his throat with a broken paper cutter blade. However, Freddy was shown to still be alive and he killed Nancy's mother, Gwen Holbrook, from the mirror reflection.

The biggest difference were his burns, while the previous Freddy Kruegers did indeed look burnt the remake's Freddy's burns looked much more realistic and made Freddy realistically look like a person who had been horribly burnt. This Freddy also had a noticeable hole in his left cheek as well as one milky cloudy eye and one red blood shot eye. Along with those, this version of Freddy Krueger looked more gaunt and thinner than the previous Freddy Kruegers.\n  \n\n\n    Quotes\n   \n\n\n\n    Trivia\n   \n\n\n\n    To be moved here\n   \n\n\n\n    List of confirmed human molestation victims of Freddy Krueger\n   \n\n\n\n    Nancy Holbrook\n   \n\n    Kris Fowles\n   \n\n    Dean Russell\n   \n\n    Jessie Braun\n   \n\n    Quentin Smith\n   \n\n\n\n    List of confirmed human murder victims of Freddy Krueger\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Dean Russell\n    \n    - Killed in Springwood Diner via infliction of honey knife slitting throat.\n   \n\n\n     Kris Fowles\n    \n    - Killed in home via glove blade slice across chest.\n   \n\n\n     Jesse Braun\n    \n    - Killed in Springwood Police Station Cell via puncture hole through chest.\n   \n\n\n     Marcus Yeon\n    \n    - Killed in home via head shove into computer screen.\n   \n\n\n     Gwen Holbrook\n    \n    - Killed in home via puncture wounds of blades through head.\n   \n\n\n     Lisa Harper\n    \n    - Killed in her sleep by unknown causes.\n   \n\n\n     Bret Tanzer\n    \n    - Killed in car crash from staying up too long.\n   \n\n\n     Nancy Lumb\n    \n    - Killed by Freddy by unknown circumstance.\n   \n\n\n     Carrie Bush\n    \n    - Killed by Freddy by unknown circumstance.\n   \n\n\n     Craig Jackson\n    \n    - Killed by Freddy by unknown circumstance.\n   \n\n\n     Elizabeth Cook\n    \n    - Killed by Freddy by unknown circumstance.\n   \n\n\n     Sukari McGill\n    \n    - Killed by Freddy by unknown circumstance.\n   \n\n\n\n    Animal victims\n   \n\n\n   He apparently killed\n   Rufus\n   in a dream.\n  \n\n\n    Trivia\n   \n\n\n\n    Billy Bob Thornton was considered for the role of Freddy Krueger.\n   \n\n\n     Jackie Earle Haley\n    \n    , who played Freddy, originally auditioned for the role of\n    \n     Glen Lantz\n    \n    in the original\n    \n     Elm Street\n    \n    , but lost to his friend,\n    \n     Johnny Depp\n    \n    . Haley went on and portrayed Freddy in the remake 26 years later.\n   \n\n    The remake Freddy being a child molester was something that Wes Craven had wanted the original Freddy to be in the first Nightmare film, but it being straight out stated was dropped in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time. However, it is strongly implied at times in the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series. It is, however, straight out stated in\n    \n     Freddy's Nightmares: A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Series\n    \n    , which is a different story than any of the movies, in the episode \"\n    \n     It's My Party and You'll Die If I Want You To\n    \n    \".\n   \n\n    This version of Freddy makes an appearance as a\n    \n     DLC Character\n    \n    for the reboot and ninth entry of the fighting game series,\n    \n     Mortal Kombat\n    \n    . Despite his resemblance to the 2010 remake's version of Freddy though, he is voiced by Patrick Seitz imitating Robert Englund's voice as the character.\n   \n\n    This version of Freddy was added as DLC killer for the online survival horror game\n    \n     Dead By Daylight\n    \n    in 2017, along with\n    \n     Quentin Smith\n    \n    as a playable survivor.

His parents divorced when he was a teenager and his mother married, as her second husband, Robert Palmer (died 2000), whom Depp called \"an inspiration to me\".\n   The Depp family in the United States began with a French\n   Huguenot\n   immigrant, Pierre Deppe or Dieppe, who settled in\n   Virginia\n   around 1700,\n   part of a refugee colony situated above the falls on the James River. The actor has also surmised that he is part\n   Native American\n   , saying in 2011, \"I guess I have some Native American [in me] somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.\"\n  \n\n   The family moved frequently during Depp's childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in\n   Miramar\n   , Florida, in 1970. In 1978, Depp's parents divorced. He engaged in\n   self-harm\n   as a child, due to the stress of dealing with family problems. He has seven or eight self-inflicted scars. In a 1993 interview, he explained his self-injury by saying, \"My body is a journal in a way. It's like what sailors used to do, where every\n   tattoo\n   meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\".\n  \n\n\n    1980s\n   \n\n\n   With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various\n   garage bands\n   . His first band was in honor of his girlfriend, Meredith. A year after his parents' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician. As he said on\n   \n    Inside the Actors Studio\n   \n   , he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band\n   Rock City Angels\n   and co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on Rock City Angels' debut for\n   Geffen Records\n   titled\n   \n    Young Man's Blues\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, a makeup artist and sister of his band's bass player and singer. During Depp's marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a\n   telemarketer\n   for pens. His wife introduced him to actor\n   Nicolas Cage\n   , who advised Depp to pursue an acting career. They divorced in 1985. Depp later dated and was engaged to\n   Sherilyn Fenn\n   (whom he met on the set of the 1985 short film\n   \n    Dummies\n   \n   ). Both\n   Sherilyn Fenn\n   and Depp auditioned for the 1986 film\n   Thrashin'\n   and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film's director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp's first major role. Depp was later turned down by the film's producer who rejected the directors decision.\n  \n\n\n    Career\n   \n\n\n   Johnny Depp at the\n   1992 Cannes Film Festival\n   ===Television===\nDepp starred in a lead role on the\n   Fox TV\n   television series,\n   \n    21 Jump Street\n   \n   , which premiered in 1987. Depp accepted this role to work with actor\n   Frederic Forrest\n   , who inspired him. Depp's long time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. The series' success turned Depp into a popular\n   teen idol\n   during the late 1980s. He felt \"forced into the role of product.\"\n   Depp decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him.\n  \n\n\n    Film roles\n   \n\n\n   Depp's first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film\n   \n\n     A Nightmare on Elm Street\n    \n\n   , playing the boyfriend of the heroine,\n   \n    Nancy Thompson\n   \n   , (played by\n   \n    Heather Langenkamp\n   \n   ) and one of\n   \n    's\n   \n   victims. He originally went with his friend\n   \n    Jackie Earle Haley\n   \n   as company while he auditioned for a part in the film, however, Depp was given a role instead as\n   \n    Glen Lantz\n   \n   while 26 years later Haley would get the part of Freddy Krueger in the remake.  Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the now classic, 1986 American skater drama film\n   Thrashin'\n   , chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film's producer.\n   In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a\n   Vietnamese\n   -speaking private in\n   Oliver Stone\n   's\n   \n    Platoon\n   \n   . In 1990 he undertook the quirky title role of the\n   Tim Burton\n   film,\n   \n    Edward Scissorhands\n   \n   . The film's success began his long association with Burton.\n  \n\n   Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer\n   Hunter S. Thompson\n   , played a version of Thompson (named\n   Raoul Duke\n   ) in 1998's\n   \n    Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n   \n   , based on the writer's pseudobiographical novel of the same name. Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author's last book tours.\n   In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to\n   \n    Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson\n   \n   , a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com. Depp paid for most of Thompson's memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson's ashes by a cannon, in\n   Aspen\n   , Colorado, where Thompson lived.\n  \n\n   Critics have described Depp's roles as characters who are \"iconic loners.\"\n   Depp has noted this period of his career was full of \"studio defined failures\" and films that were \"box office poison,\"\n   but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing.\n   Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office.\n   Depp wearing a\n   mustache\n   and\n   goatee\n   similar to the style used in\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n   \n   The 2003\n   Walt Disney Pictures\n   film\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n   \n   was a major success,\n   in which Depp's performance as the suave pirate Captain\n   Jack Sparrow\n   was highly praised. Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first,\n   but the character became popular with the movie-going public.\n   According to a survey taken by\n   Fandango\n   , Depp was a major draw for audiences.\n   The film's director,\n   Gore Verbinski\n   , has said that Depp's character closely resembles the actor's personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after\n   Rolling Stones\n   guitarist\n   Keith Richards\n   .\n   Depp was nominated for an\n   Academy Award for Best Actor\n   for the role.\n  \n\n   In 2004, he was nominated for an\n   Academy Award for Best Actor\n   , for playing Scottish author\n   J. M. Barrie\n   in the film\n   \n    Finding Neverland\n   \n   . Depp next starred as\n   Willy Wonka\n   in the 2005 film\n   \n    Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n   \n   , a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the\n   Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy\n   .\n  \n\n   Depp returned to the role of Jack Sparrow for the sequel\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\n   \n   , which opened on July 7, 2006 and grossed $135.5 million in the first three days of its U.S. release, breaking a box office record of the highest weekend tally.\n   The next sequel to\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean\n   \n   ,\n   \n    At World's End\n   \n   , was released May 24, 2007.

    "question": "What is the movie about?",
    "response": "\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" is a classic horror film that centers on a group of teenagers terrorized by a vengeful spirit named Freddy Krueger, who was a child murderer burned alive by the parents of his victims. In the dreams of these teens, Freddy stalks and kills them using his razor-sharp glove, blurring the lines between reality and nightmares—making sleep a deadly trap. The 2010 remake, directed by Samuel Bayer, follows a similar premise but updates the story with modern elements, focusing on characters like Nancy (the protagonist who fights back) and Dean Russell, played by Kellan Lutz, who becomes one of Freddy's early targets. In the original 1984 film, Johnny Depp portrayed Glen Lantz, a supportive friend who meets a gruesome fate, marking one of his early roles. Core themes include fear of the subconscious, the consequences of vigilante justice, and the vulnerability of youth, all amplified through suspenseful horror elements like dream sequences and psychological terror. This film series is renowned for its innovative use of dreams as a horror device, blending gore, suspense, and emotional depth to create a chilling experience.",

His parents divorced when he was a teenager and his mother married, as her second husband, Robert Palmer (died 2000), whom Depp called \"an inspiration to me\".\n   The Depp family in the United States began with a French\n   Huguenot\n   immigrant, Pierre Deppe or Dieppe, who settled in\n   Virginia\n   around 1700,\n   part of a refugee colony situated above the falls on the James River. The actor has also surmised that he is part\n   Native American\n   , saying in 2011, \"I guess I have some Native American [in me] somewhere down the line. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek.\"\n  \n\n   The family moved frequently during Depp's childhood, and he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different locations, settling in\n   Miramar\n   , Florida, in 1970. In 1978, Depp's parents divorced. He engaged in\n   self-harm\n   as a child, due to the stress of dealing with family problems. He has seven or eight self-inflicted scars. In a 1993 interview, he explained his self-injury by saying, \"My body is a journal in a way. It's like what sailors used to do, where every\n   tattoo\n   meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\".\n  \n\n\n    1980s\n   \n\n\n   With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various\n   garage bands\n   . His first band was in honor of his girlfriend, Meredith. A year after his parents' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician. As he said on\n   \n    Inside the Actors Studio\n   \n   , he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band\n   Rock City Angels\n   and co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on Rock City Angels' debut for\n   Geffen Records\n   titled\n   \n    Young Man's Blues\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, a makeup artist and sister of his band's bass player and singer. During Depp's marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a\n   telemarketer\n   for pens. His wife introduced him to actor\n   Nicolas Cage\n   , who advised Depp to pursue an acting career. They divorced in 1985. Depp later dated and was engaged to\n   Sherilyn Fenn\n   (whom he met on the set of the 1985 short film\n   \n    Dummies\n   \n   ). Both\n   Sherilyn Fenn\n   and Depp auditioned for the 1986 film\n   Thrashin'\n   and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film's director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp's first major role. Depp was later turned down by the film's producer who rejected the directors decision.\n  \n\n\n    Career\n   \n\n\n   Johnny Depp at the\n   1992 Cannes Film Festival\n   ===Television===\nDepp starred in a lead role on the\n   Fox TV\n   television series,\n   \n    21 Jump Street\n   \n   , which premiered in 1987. Depp accepted this role to work with actor\n   Frederic Forrest\n   , who inspired him. Depp's long time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. The series' success turned Depp into a popular\n   teen idol\n   during the late 1980s. He felt \"forced into the role of product.\"\n   Depp decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him.\n  \n\n\n    Film roles\n   \n\n\n   Depp's first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film\n   \n\n     A Nightmare on Elm Street\n    \n\n   , playing the boyfriend of the heroine,\n   \n    Nancy Thompson\n   \n   , (played by\n   \n    Heather Langenkamp\n   \n   ) and one of\n   \n    's\n   \n   victims. He originally went with his friend\n   \n    Jackie Earle Haley\n   \n   as company while he auditioned for a part in the film, however, Depp was given a role instead as\n   \n    Glen Lantz\n   \n   while 26 years later Haley would get the part of Freddy Krueger in the remake.  Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the now classic, 1986 American skater drama film\n   Thrashin'\n   , chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film's producer.\n   In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a\n   Vietnamese\n   -speaking private in\n   Oliver Stone\n   's\n   \n    Platoon\n   \n   . In 1990 he undertook the quirky title role of the\n   Tim Burton\n   film,\n   \n    Edward Scissorhands\n   \n   . The film's success began his long association with Burton.\n  \n\n   Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer\n   Hunter S. Thompson\n   , played a version of Thompson (named\n   Raoul Duke\n   ) in 1998's\n   \n    Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n   \n   , based on the writer's pseudobiographical novel of the same name. Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author's last book tours.\n   In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to\n   \n    Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson\n   \n   , a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com. Depp paid for most of Thompson's memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson's ashes by a cannon, in\n   Aspen\n   , Colorado, where Thompson lived.\n  \n\n   Critics have described Depp's roles as characters who are \"iconic loners.\"\n   Depp has noted this period of his career was full of \"studio defined failures\" and films that were \"box office poison,\"\n   but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing.\n   Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office.\n   Depp wearing a\n   mustache\n   and\n   goatee\n   similar to the style used in\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n   \n   The 2003\n   Walt Disney Pictures\n   film\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n   \n   was a major success,\n   in which Depp's performance as the suave pirate Captain\n   Jack Sparrow\n   was highly praised. Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first,\n   but the character became popular with the movie-going public.\n   According to a survey taken by\n   Fandango\n   , Depp was a major draw for audiences.\n   The film's director,\n   Gore Verbinski\n   , has said that Depp's character closely resembles the actor's personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after\n   Rolling Stones\n   guitarist\n   Keith Richards\n   .\n   Depp was nominated for an\n   Academy Award for Best Actor\n   for the role.\n  \n\n   In 2004, he was nominated for an\n   Academy Award for Best Actor\n   , for playing Scottish author\n   J. M. Barrie\n   in the film\n   \n    Finding Neverland\n   \n   . Depp next starred as\n   Willy Wonka\n   in the 2005 film\n   \n    Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n   \n   , a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the\n   Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy\n   .\n  \n\n   Depp returned to the role of Jack Sparrow for the sequel\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\n   \n   , which opened on July 7, 2006 and grossed $135.5 million in the first three days of its U.S. release, breaking a box office record of the highest weekend tally.\n   The next sequel to\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean\n   \n   ,\n   \n    At World's End\n   \n   , was released May 24, 2007.

It's like what sailors used to do, where every\n   tattoo\n   meant something, a specific time in your life when you make a mark on yourself, whether you do it yourself with a knife or with a professional tattoo artist\".\n  \n\n\n    1980s\n   \n\n\n   With the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, Depp began playing in various\n   garage bands\n   . His first band was in honor of his girlfriend, Meredith. A year after his parents' divorce, Depp dropped out of high school to become a rock musician. As he said on\n   \n    Inside the Actors Studio\n   \n   , he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. He played with The Kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success. The Kids set out together for Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to Six Gun Method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. Depp subsequently collaborated with the band\n   Rock City Angels\n   and co-wrote their song \"Mary\", which appeared on Rock City Angels' debut for\n   Geffen Records\n   titled\n   \n    Young Man's Blues\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   On December 24, 1983, Depp married Lori Anne Allison, a makeup artist and sister of his band's bass player and singer. During Depp's marriage, his wife worked as a makeup artist while he worked a variety of odd jobs, including a\n   telemarketer\n   for pens. His wife introduced him to actor\n   Nicolas Cage\n   , who advised Depp to pursue an acting career. They divorced in 1985. Depp later dated and was engaged to\n   Sherilyn Fenn\n   (whom he met on the set of the 1985 short film\n   \n    Dummies\n   \n   ). Both\n   Sherilyn Fenn\n   and Depp auditioned for the 1986 film\n   Thrashin'\n   and they were both cast, with Depp being chosen by the film's director to star as the lead, which would have been Depp's first major role. Depp was later turned down by the film's producer who rejected the directors decision.\n  \n\n\n    Career\n   \n\n\n   Johnny Depp at the\n   1992 Cannes Film Festival\n   ===Television===\nDepp starred in a lead role on the\n   Fox TV\n   television series,\n   \n    21 Jump Street\n   \n   , which premiered in 1987. Depp accepted this role to work with actor\n   Frederic Forrest\n   , who inspired him. Depp's long time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. The series' success turned Depp into a popular\n   teen idol\n   during the late 1980s. He felt \"forced into the role of product.\"\n   Depp decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him.\n  \n\n\n    Film roles\n   \n\n\n   Depp's first major role was in the 1984 classic horror film\n   \n\n     A Nightmare on Elm Street\n    \n\n   , playing the boyfriend of the heroine,\n   \n    Nancy Thompson\n   \n   , (played by\n   \n    Heather Langenkamp\n   \n   ) and one of\n   \n    's\n   \n   victims. He originally went with his friend\n   \n    Jackie Earle Haley\n   \n   as company while he auditioned for a part in the film, however, Depp was given a role instead as\n   \n    Glen Lantz\n   \n   while 26 years later Haley would get the part of Freddy Krueger in the remake.  Depp was the first choice and was cast to star in the now classic, 1986 American skater drama film\n   Thrashin'\n   , chosen and cast by the director but ultimately rejected by the film's producer.\n   In 1986, he appeared in a secondary role as a\n   Vietnamese\n   -speaking private in\n   Oliver Stone\n   's\n   \n    Platoon\n   \n   . In 1990 he undertook the quirky title role of the\n   Tim Burton\n   film,\n   \n    Edward Scissorhands\n   \n   . The film's success began his long association with Burton.\n  \n\n   Depp, a fan and long-time friend of writer\n   Hunter S. Thompson\n   , played a version of Thompson (named\n   Raoul Duke\n   ) in 1998's\n   \n    Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n   \n   , based on the writer's pseudobiographical novel of the same name. Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author's last book tours.\n   In 2006, Depp contributed a foreword to\n   \n    Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson\n   \n   , a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com. Depp paid for most of Thompson's memorial event, complete with fireworks and the shooting of Thompson's ashes by a cannon, in\n   Aspen\n   , Colorado, where Thompson lived.\n  \n\n   Critics have described Depp's roles as characters who are \"iconic loners.\"\n   Depp has noted this period of his career was full of \"studio defined failures\" and films that were \"box office poison,\"\n   but he thought the studios never understood the films and did not do a good job of marketing.\n   Depp has chosen roles which he found interesting, rather than those he thought would succeed at the box office.\n   Depp wearing a\n   mustache\n   and\n   goatee\n   similar to the style used in\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n   \n   The 2003\n   Walt Disney Pictures\n   film\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n   \n   was a major success,\n   in which Depp's performance as the suave pirate Captain\n   Jack Sparrow\n   was highly praised. Studio bosses were more ambivalent at first,\n   but the character became popular with the movie-going public.\n   According to a survey taken by\n   Fandango\n   , Depp was a major draw for audiences.\n   The film's director,\n   Gore Verbinski\n   , has said that Depp's character closely resembles the actor's personality, but Depp said he modeled the character after\n   Rolling Stones\n   guitarist\n   Keith Richards\n   .\n   Depp was nominated for an\n   Academy Award for Best Actor\n   for the role.\n  \n\n   In 2004, he was nominated for an\n   Academy Award for Best Actor\n   , for playing Scottish author\n   J. M. Barrie\n   in the film\n   \n    Finding Neverland\n   \n   . Depp next starred as\n   Willy Wonka\n   in the 2005 film\n   \n    Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n   \n   , a major success at the box office and earning him a nomination for the\n   Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy\n   .\n  \n\n   Depp returned to the role of Jack Sparrow for the sequel\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\n   \n   , which opened on July 7, 2006 and grossed $135.5 million in the first three days of its U.S. release, breaking a box office record of the highest weekend tally.\n   The next sequel to\n   \n    Pirates of the Caribbean\n   \n   ,\n   \n    At World's End\n   \n   , was released May 24, 2007.

    "question": "Is the Batman comic similar to the movies?",
    "response": "Yes, Batman comics and movies share many core similarities, but they also have notable differences that make each medium unique, depending on what you're looking for in your experience. Let me break this down for you based on key elements, themes, and character portrayals, drawing from the history outlined in the context.\n\n### Core Elements:\n- **Similarities**: Both comics and movies center on Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman, his mission to protect Gotham City, and his reliance on gadgets, intellect, and physical prowess. For instance, villains like the Joker, Penguin, and Catwoman appear in both, often driving the plot through conflicts involving crime, chaos, and moral dilemmas. In the movies (e.g., Tim Burton's anthology or Christopher Nolan's trilogy), these elements are adapted directly from comic lore, such as Batman's origin and his rogues gallery, making the foundational story feel familiar.\n- **Differences**: Comics, like those written by Doug Moench (e.g., in *Detective Comics* or *Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight*), often delve into more serialized, ongoing narratives with intricate plots and multiple story arcs. This allows for deeper world-building, such as exploring Gotham's underbelly or Batman's psychological struggles over time. Movies, on the other hand, condense these into standalone or trilogy formats for broader appeal, focusing on high-stakes action and visual effects, as seen in films like *Batman Begins* or *The Dark Knight*.\n\n### Themes:\n- **Similarities**: Themes of justice, vigilantism, and the blurred line between heroism and obsession are common in both. For example, the struggle against corruption in Gotham and Batman's internal conflict with his dual identity resonate across media, reflecting a shared exploration of morality and redemption.\n- **Differences**: Comics tend to emphasize psychological depth and social commentary, such as in Moench's works that tackle themes of fear, identity, and societal decay in a more introspective way. Movies often amplify these for dramatic effect, leaning toward spectacle (e.g., Nolan's realistic, gritty tone in *The Dark Knight Trilogy*) or campiness (e.g., Burton's style), which can make themes more accessible but less nuanced for casual viewers.\n\n### Character Portrayals:\n- **Similarities**: Batman is consistently portrayed as a brooding, resourceful hero in both formats, with allies like Alfred and Commissioner Gordon playing supportive roles. Villains, such as the Joker or Two-Face, maintain their iconic traits, like chaos and duality, which translate well from comics to screen.\n- **Differences**: In comics, characters like Batman can evolve over years of stories, showing more vulnerability and complexity (e.g., Moench's portrayals in crossovers like *Batman versus Predator II*). Movies adapt these selectively; for instance, actors like Michael Keaton or Christian Bale bring a cinematic intensity that highlights physicality and emotion, but they might simplify backstories to fit runtime constraints.\n\nOverall, comics often provide a more immersive and flexible experience, allowing for endless exploration and fan theories, which could enhance your enjoyment if you're seeking depth for academic study or personal engagement. Movies, however, offer a polished, visual spectacle that might feel more immediate and exciting for entertainment. If you're deciding what to try next, start with a classic comic like Moench's *Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight* for a deeper dive, or rewatch a film like *Batman Begins* for a cinematic comparison. This way, you can see how stories evolve and choose based on your preferences—comics might feel enhanced for long-term engagement, while movies provide a quicker, similar thrill.",

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist\n   \n    Bob Kane\n   \n   and writer\n   \n    Bill Finger\n   \n   . The character made his first appearance in\n   \n\n     Detective Comics\n    \n    #27\n   \n   (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of\n   \n    Bruce Wayne\n   \n   . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , beneath\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   assisted by his butler\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   . That and the success of director\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World's Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       History\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n\n          Early Life\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Golden Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Silver Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Modern Batman\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Knightfall\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Batman R.I.P.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.7\n        \n\n         \"Death\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.8\n        \n\n         Return\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.9\n        \n\n         New 52\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.10\n        \n\n         DC Rebirth\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.11\n        \n\n         The Joker War\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.12\n        \n\n         Infinite Frontier\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Personality\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Relationships\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Family\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Romances\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Allies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.4\n        \n\n         Enemies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Abilities\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Paraphernalia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Equipment\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           5.1.1\n          \n\n           Former Equipment\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Weapons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Transportation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Other Media\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Notes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    History\n   \n\n\n\n    For key points in Batman's history see\n    Batman's publication history\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Early Life\n    \n\n\n\n   Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable\n   \n    Gotham City\n   \n   socialites. Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named\n   \n    Joe Chill\n   \n   . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives.\n  \n\n   As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   . He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.\n  \n\n\n    Modern Batman\n   \n\n\n   After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences.\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   retold Batman's origin in the storyline\n   \n    Year One\n   \n   from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.

    "question": "How old was batman when he first became batman?",
    "response": "Based on the context, Bruce Wayne, who becomes Batman, likely started his crime-fighting career in his early 20s. This is inferred from the timeline: his parents were killed when he was a young boy, he made a vow then, and by his teenage years, he was involved in other aspects of life like friendships and managing Wayne Industries. He then progressed to becoming Batman as an adult, though the exact age isn't specified in the details provided.",

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots.\n  \n\n\n    Powers and Abilities\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Master Acrobat:\n    \n    Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.\n   \n\n\n     Peak Human Conditioning:\n    \n    Through intense training, Batman represents the pinnacle of human physical potential.

    "response": "No, Batman does not have superpowers like invisibility or the ability to organically shoot a web from his hands. Unlike many other superheroes, such as Spider-Man who gains his abilities from a spider bite, Batman relies entirely on his human skills and resources. He uses his genius-level intelligence, expert detective work, martial arts training, advanced technology (like his gadgets and the Batmobile), and sheer physical conditioning to fight crime. This makes him unique among superheroes because he represents what an ordinary person can achieve through determination and preparation, which is a key part of his character and helps differentiate him in comic book stories. If you're comparing characters or exploring superhero archetypes, this focus on human potential is what sets Batman apart and makes his stories so compelling!",

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist\n   \n    Bob Kane\n   \n   and writer\n   \n    Bill Finger\n   \n   . The character made his first appearance in\n   \n\n     Detective Comics\n    \n    #27\n   \n   (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of\n   \n    Bruce Wayne\n   \n   . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , beneath\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   assisted by his butler\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   .

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist\n   \n    Bob Kane\n   \n   and writer\n   \n    Bill Finger\n   \n   .

The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   .

Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named\n   \n    Joe Chill\n   \n   . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives.\n  \n\n   As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   . He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.\n  \n\n\n    Modern Batman\n   \n\n\n   After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences.\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   retold Batman's origin in the storyline\n   \n    Year One\n   \n   from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.

Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named\n   \n    Joe Chill\n   \n   . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives.\n  \n\n   As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.

Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades.

The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World's Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       History\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n\n          Early Life\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Golden Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Silver Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Modern Batman\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Knightfall\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Batman R.I.P.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.7\n        \n\n         \"Death\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.8\n        \n\n         Return\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.9\n        \n\n         New 52\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.10\n        \n\n         DC Rebirth\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.11\n        \n\n         The Joker War\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.12\n        \n\n         Infinite Frontier\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Personality\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Relationships\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Family\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Romances\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Allies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.4\n        \n\n         Enemies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Abilities\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Paraphernalia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Equipment\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           5.1.1\n          \n\n           Former Equipment\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Weapons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Transportation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Other Media\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Notes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    History\n   \n\n\n\n    For key points in Batman's history see\n    Batman's publication history\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Early Life\n    \n\n\n\n   Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable\n   \n    Gotham City\n   \n   socialites. Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named\n   \n    Joe Chill\n   \n   . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives.\n  \n\n   As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   . He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.\n  \n\n\n    Modern Batman\n   \n\n\n   After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences.\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   retold Batman's origin in the storyline\n   \n    Year One\n   \n   from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots.\n  \n\n\n    Powers and Abilities\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Master Acrobat:\n    \n    Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.\n   \n\n\n     Peak Human Conditioning:\n    \n    Through intense training, Batman represents the pinnacle of human physical potential.

Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , beneath\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   assisted by his butler\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   . That and the success of director\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World's Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       History\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n\n          Early Life\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Golden Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Silver Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Modern Batman\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Knightfall\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Batman R.I.P.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.7\n        \n\n         \"Death\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.8\n        \n\n         Return\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.9\n        \n\n         New 52\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.10\n        \n\n         DC Rebirth\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.11\n        \n\n         The Joker War\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.12\n        \n\n         Infinite Frontier\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Personality\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Relationships\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Family\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Romances\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Allies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.4\n        \n\n         Enemies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Abilities\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Paraphernalia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Equipment\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           5.1.1\n          \n\n           Former Equipment\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Weapons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Transportation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Other Media\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Notes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    History\n   \n\n\n\n    For key points in Batman's history see\n    Batman's publication history\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Early Life\n    \n\n\n\n   Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable\n   \n    Gotham City\n   \n   socialites. Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight.

After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives.\n  \n\n   As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police.

Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   . He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.\n  \n\n\n    Modern Batman\n   \n\n\n   After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences.\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   retold Batman's origin in the storyline\n   \n    Year One\n   \n   from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.

    "response": "Yes, Batman is indeed a superhero. He is the alter ego of Bruce Wayne, a highly skilled individual who uses his intelligence, martial arts expertise, and gadgets to fight crime and protect Gotham City. Unlike characters with superpowers, Batman's abilities come from rigorous training and his vast resources, making him a prime example of a \"human\" superhero in comic book lore. This is evident from his origins in Detective Comics #27 in 1939 and his ongoing role as a cultural icon.",

Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight.

After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   .

This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   .

Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named\n   \n    Joe Chill\n   \n   . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives.\n  \n\n   As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department.

During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age.

In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   .

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist\n   \n    Bob Kane\n   \n   and writer\n   \n    Bill Finger\n   \n   . The character made his first appearance in\n   \n\n     Detective Comics\n    \n    #27\n   \n   (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of\n   \n    Bruce Wayne\n   \n   . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , beneath\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   assisted by his butler\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   . That and the success of director\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world.

He played opposite Chuck Connors in\n   \n    Geronimo\n   \n   (1962) and Joe DeRita in\n   \n    The Outlaws Is Coming\n   \n   (1965). He also appeared in the science fiction film,\n   \n    Robinson Crusoe on Mars\n   \n   (1964) alongside Paul Mantee, and, unsurprisingly, achieved continuing success for the title role in the 1960s ABC series\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   and its theatrical feature film.\n  \n\n   West was contacted for a screen test after\n   William Dozier\n   saw West perform as the James Bond-like spy Captain Q in a Nestlé Quik television ad. West was in competition with Lyle Waggoner (who later acted out Steve Trevor and, later, his lookalike son Steve Trevor Jr. in the 1970s television version of\n   \n\n     Wonder Woman\n    \n\n   which starred Lynda Carter in the title role) for the Batman role. West became the third actor to play Bruce Wayne/Batman in live action, succeeding\n   Robert Lowery\n   .\n  \n\n   The popular show, which was deliberately produced as a lampoon comedy but drew accusations of being \"campy\" that bothered West throughout his entire career, ran on ABC from 1966 to 1968; a film version was released in July of 1966. At this time, the DC Comics that were featuring Batman himself were experiencing dismal sales, and were threatened with cancellation after approximately twenty-five years; West, when he dictated his autobiography,\n   \n    Back To The Batcave,\n   \n   to Jeff Rovin, pointed out that the \"Batuation comedy\" saved Batman's DC Comics from cancellation and enabled a new generation to get to know the character as he had originally been created.\n  \n\n\n    Return Performances as Batman\n   \n\n\n   West often reprised his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, first in the short-lived animated series\n   \n    The New Adventures of Batman\n   \n   and later in other shows such as\n   \n    The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour,\n   \n\n    Tarzan and the Super 7,\n   \n\n    Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show,\n   \n   and\n   \n    The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians;\n   \n   he succeeded Olan Soule in this last role. In 1979, West once again donned the Bat-Costume for the live-action TV special\n   \n    Legends of the Superheroes\n   \n   . In 1985, DC Comics named West as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication\n   \n    Fifty Who Made DC Great\n   \n   for his work on the\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   series. In 1997 West returned to the Role of Bruce Wayne/Batman for the first time in 12 years for the animated short \"Boo Wonder\" on the animated TV series\n   \n    Animaniacs.\n   \n   In one installment of\n   \n    Batman: The Animated Series,\n   \n   he provided the character voice of an actor whose career had stalled due to typecasting as a Batman-like character called \"The Gray Ghost.\" (See below.) In 2016, and again in 2017, West returned to voice Batman in two animated features,\n   \n    Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders\n   \n   and\n   \n    Batman vs Two Face!\n   \n   Both animated features were based on the original 1960s TV series. The latter was released posthumously and proved to be West's final work; deathly ill with leukemia during the recording sessions for\n   \n    Batman Versus Two-Face!\n   \n   though he worked through his illness, he died between his having finished recording all his dialog and the film's release.\n  \n\n\n    1992 Installment: Simon Trent\n   \n\n\n   West provided a character voice for a 1992 installment of\n   \n    Batman: The Animated Series\n   \n   on Fox, but\n   \n    NOT\n   \n   that of Batman, since the character voice of\n   Batman\n   was already being provided by\n   Kevin Conroy\n   . Instead, he provided the character voice of\n   Simon Trent\n   , an out-of-work actor who had once acted out a super-hero similar to Batman himself in a TV series called\n   \n    The Gray Ghost,\n   \n   and who was now considered a washed-up had-been as far as motion pictures and television went; he now had a great deal of difficulty finding acting work due to typecasting. The producers nearly considered scrapping that installment as they figured it mirrored Adam West too much; however, West had already made his peace with his public identification as Batman, and he gladly accepted voicing such a character.\n  \n\n\n    Mayor Grange Voice\n   \n\n\n   West later had a recurring role as the voice of Mayor Grange in the WB animated series\n   \n    The Batman\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n    CGI File: Batman\n   \n\n\n   The actor vocally reprised his role as Batman for the CGI animated short film\n   \n    Batman: New Times\n   \n   . He co-starred with\n   Mark Hamill\n   , who vocally portrayed the\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   and had originally played the role on\n   \n    Batman: The Animated Series.\n   \n   West also voiced\n   \n    Thomas Wayne\n   \n   , Bruce Wayne's father, in an episode of the cartoon series\n   \n\n     Batman: The Brave and the Bold\n    \n    .\n   \n   In the same series, he played Batman's prototype robot, aptly named \"Protobot,\" or \"Proto\" for short. He also did voice work on animated series such as\n   \n    The Fairly OddParents\n   \n   and\n   \n    Family Guy,\n   \n   in both of which he voiced fictional versions of himself.\n  \n\n\n    In comics\n   \n\n\n   BlueWater Comics published\n   \n    The Mis-Adventures of Adam West,\n   \n   which told the adventures of West in various movie parodies where he, a classic hero type who rejected the darkening nature of heroes in films, would always save the day. Throughout the series, he would appear in Gotham City, and certain iconic Batman moments would be redrawn with West as Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Characters portrayed by Adam West in the Batman Universe\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Bruce Wayne\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Batman\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Batman\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Batman\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Simon Trent (Voice)\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Gray Ghost (Voice)\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Marion Grange (Voice)\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Thomas Wayne (Voice)\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Doug Moench\n    \n\n\n      General Information\n     \n\n\n       Birth Date:\n      \n\n       February 23, 1948\n      \n\n\n\n       Birth Place:\n      \n\n       Chicago, Illinois USA\n      \n\n\n\n\n    Doug Moench\n   \n   is an American writer.

    "question": "Did Batman start with a book or a movie?",
    "response": "Batman originally started as a comic book, not a movie. According to the context provided, the character made his debut in comics, as evidenced by the reference to the 1989 film being released \"a month after Batman's 50th anniversary of his comic debut.\" This suggests that Batman first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in 1939, created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger for DC Comics, long before any films were produced.\n\nTo support your learning, I recommend exploring DC Comics' official website or resources like the DC Comics history page on Wikipedia for more details on Batman's origins. Books such as \"The Batman Chronicles\" or \"Batman: The Definitive History of the Dark Knight in Comics, Film, and Beyond\" by Andrew Farago could provide deeper insights into his evolution across media.",

After a breakdown in negation regarding the script, Val Kilmer chose not to return.\n   George Clooney\n   took over the role of Batman while Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as Robin/Dick Grayson.

A animated home video tie-tin,\n   \n    Batman: Gotham Knight\n   \n   was released to promote the film.

This prompted them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a fifth film, but writer\n   Akiva Goldsman\n   , who worked on\n   \n    Batman Forever\n   \n   and\n   \n    Batman & Robin\n   \n   with Schumacher, turned down the chance to write the script. In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired\n   Mark Protosevich\n   to write the script for a fifth\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced. Titled\n   \n    Batman Unchained\n   \n   , Protosevich's script had the\n   \n    Scarecrow\n   \n   as the main villain and it would bring back the franchise in a more serious and darker direction, unlike the previous two films.\n  \n\n   The script dealt with Batman learning to conquer fear and to confront the demons of his past.\n   \n    The Joker\n   \n   would return as a hallucination in Batman's mind caused by the Scarecrow's fear toxin, along with\n   \n    Penguin\n   \n   ,\n   Catwoman\n   ,\n   \n    Two-Face\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Riddler\n   \n   , all together to judge the hero on trial.\n   \n    Harley Quinn\n   \n   appeared as a toymaker, written as the Joker's daughter trying to get revenge on Batman for the Joker's death. Crane discovers Batman's identity and forms an alliance with Harley to lead him to madness and lock him in\n   Arkham Asylum\n   .\n  \n\n   In the script, Robin abandons Batman for disagreements, but he returns during the final battle to help his mentor. After defeating his enemies and his demons, Bruce makes a trip to Bali and enters a cave full of bats, with them flying around him, as a proof for having conquered his fears.\n  \n\n   George Clooney\n   and\n   Chris O'Donnell\n   were set to reprise the roles of\n   Batman\n   and\n   Robin\n   , respectively.\n  \n\n   Schumacher offered the part of the Scarecrow to Nicolas Cage while filming\n   \n    Face/Off\n   \n   and Courtney Love was proposed for the role of Harley.\n  \n\n   However, when\n   \n    Batman & Robin\n   \n   received negative reviews and failed to outgross any of its predecessors on its release, the idea was to continue the big budget spectacle but Warner Bros. were unsure of their plans for\n   \n    Batman Unchained\n   \n   and George Clooney vowed never to wear the cape and cowl again. Director of the previous two films\n   Joel Schumacher\n   claimed that he turned down the chance to return stating that he lost his \"passion\" for Batman in film and didn't want to turn the passion into just a job. In reality it seemed the studio was unwilling to to gamble on his vision.\n  \n\n   In the aftermath producer\n   Peter MacGregor-Scott\n   was relegated to making\n   OnStar\n   commercials featuring\n   Bruce Thomas\n   as\n   Batman\n   . Surviving costume pieces like\n   Clooney's Batsuit\n   and\n   Kilmer's Cowl\n   as well as the Batcave set were re-used in the television spots.

The new approach to a fifth movie focused on more physiological nuance and building a more subtle dark atmosphere, keeping the budget more reasonable to address criticisms of the previous movie. Ultimately the studio decided it was best to consider something completely different rather a fifth sequel.\n  \n\n   A live-action\n   \n\n     Batman Beyond\n    \n\n   film and an adaptation of\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n\n     Batman: Year One\n    \n\n   were both developed.

    "question": "how old is batman?",
    "response": "Batman, whose real identity is Bruce Wayne, doesn't have a fixed age in the DC Comics universe because his story spans various timelines and adaptations. However, based on the details in the provided context, Bruce Wayne is generally portrayed as being in his late 20s to early 30s when he first becomes Batman. This timeline starts with the traumatic event of his parents' murder when he was a young boy (around 8-10 years old), which motivated him to dedicate his life to fighting crime. As he grew into adulthood, he honed his skills, formed alliances, and evolved as a character, as seen in series like \"The Batman\" and his involvement with the Justice League.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of his character evolution:\n- In his early years as Batman, his age reflects a peak physical and mental state, allowing him to tackle street-level crime and super-villains like the Joker.\n- Later events, such as those in 2027 mentioned in the context, show him as an older man, highlighting how time and experiences shape his motivations and methods.\n- This age progression underscores themes of loss, resilience, and growth, which are central to his backstory and make him a compelling figure in the DC universe.\n\nIf you're exploring this for educational purposes or personal interest, I recommend checking official DC Comics sources or adaptations for more specific timelines, as ages can differ between stories.",

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots.\n  \n\n\n    Powers and Abilities\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Master Acrobat:\n    \n    Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.\n   \n\n\n     Peak Human Conditioning:\n    \n    Through intense training, Batman represents the pinnacle of human physical potential.

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots.\n  \n\n\n    Powers and Abilities\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Master Acrobat:\n    \n    Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.\n   \n\n\n     Peak Human Conditioning:\n    \n    Through intense training, Batman represents the pinnacle of human physical potential. His physical characteristics are greater than that of even \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Doug Moench\n    \n\n\n      General Information\n     \n\n\n       Birth Date:\n      \n\n       February 23, 1948\n      \n\n\n\n       Birth Place:\n      \n\n       Chicago, Illinois USA\n      \n\n\n\n\n    Doug Moench\n   \n   is an American writer.

As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots.\n  \n\n\n    Powers and Abilities\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Master Acrobat:\n    \n    Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.\n   \n\n\n     Peak Human Conditioning:\n    \n    Through intense training, Batman represents the pinnacle of human physical potential.

The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   . That and the success of director\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World's Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       History\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n\n          Early Life\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Golden Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Silver Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Modern Batman\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Knightfall\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Batman R.I.P.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.7\n        \n\n         \"Death\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.8\n        \n\n         Return\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.9\n        \n\n         New 52\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.10\n        \n\n         DC Rebirth\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.11\n        \n\n         The Joker War\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.12\n        \n\n         Infinite Frontier\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Personality\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Relationships\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Family\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Romances\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Allies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.4\n        \n\n         Enemies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Abilities\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Paraphernalia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Equipment\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           5.1.1\n          \n\n           Former Equipment\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Weapons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Transportation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Other Media\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Notes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    History\n   \n\n\n\n    For key points in Batman's history see\n    Batman's publication history\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Early Life\n    \n\n\n\n   Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable\n   \n    Gotham City\n   \n   socialites. Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named\n   \n    Joe Chill\n   \n   . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives.\n  \n\n   As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   . He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.\n  \n\n\n    Modern Batman\n   \n\n\n   After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences.\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   retold Batman's origin in the storyline\n   \n    Year One\n   \n   from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist\n   \n    Bob Kane\n   \n   and writer\n   \n    Bill Finger\n   \n   .

The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   .

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist\n   \n    Bob Kane\n   \n   and writer\n   \n    Bill Finger\n   \n   . The character made his first appearance in\n   \n\n     Detective Comics\n    \n    #27\n   \n   (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of\n   \n    Bruce Wayne\n   \n   . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , beneath\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   assisted by his butler\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   . That and the success of director\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World's Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       History\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n\n          Early Life\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Golden Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Silver Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Modern Batman\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Knightfall\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Batman R.I.P.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.7\n        \n\n         \"Death\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.8\n        \n\n         Return\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.9\n        \n\n         New 52\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.10\n        \n\n         DC Rebirth\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.11\n        \n\n         The Joker War\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.12\n        \n\n         Infinite Frontier\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Personality\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Relationships\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Family\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Romances\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Allies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.4\n        \n\n         Enemies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Abilities\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Paraphernalia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Equipment\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           5.1.1\n          \n\n           Former Equipment\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Weapons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Transportation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Other Media\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Notes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    History\n   \n\n\n\n    For key points in Batman's history see\n    Batman's publication history\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Early Life\n    \n\n\n\n   Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable\n   \n    Gotham City\n   \n   socialites. Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named\n   \n    Joe Chill\n   \n   . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives.\n  \n\n   As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   . He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.\n  \n\n\n    Modern Batman\n   \n\n\n   After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences.\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   retold Batman's origin in the storyline\n   \n    Year One\n   \n   from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.

He often wears costumes to correlate with the date of the designated crime. Because his crimes are generally petty and often ridiculous in nature, he is notorious among both heroes and villains alike for being something of a joke. He has fought\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   and\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   on many occasions. Fixated on the calendar, Day oftentimes ties his crimes to certain holidays throughout the year. This often leads to him leaving clues by which he could be caught. Gotham City's hopes for a day off are often clouded by the knowledge that any holiday of note is likely to be shadowed by Calendar Man's presence.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       History\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Powers and Abilities\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       In other media\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n\n          Batman: Arkham series\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         4.2\n        \n\n         The Lego Batman Movie\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    History\n   \n\n\n\n    Calendar Man\n   \n   is fascinated by dates and calendars – even his real name is a pun on the Julian and Gregorian calendars. WHO'S WHO # 4 and Batman # 384 simultaneously confirmed the rogue's real name as Julian Day. In Batman 80-Page Giant # 3, Chuck Dixon took the 1582 revision known as the Gregorian Calendar into account by identifying the villain as Julian Gregory Day.\n  \n\n   His crimes always have a relationship to the date that they are committed. The theme may be related to what day of the week it is or to a holiday or to a special anniversary on that date; he will plan his crime around that day. He often wears different costumes which correspond to the significance of the date, though he does have a main costume which has various numbers (meant to represent days on a calendar) sprouting from the shoulders. This outfit was a red and white number that played up the calendar motif and wasn't keyed to any particular season or date. Its cape, for instance, was a collection of calendar pages. The costume reappeared on the covers of Batman # 384 and Detective Comics # 551, and the red and white suit appeared in Calendar Man's entry in WHO'S WHO '85 # 4 and was the costume Calendar Man wore during the Crisis On Infinite Earths. In Batman #400, when\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   broke all of Batman's enemies out of prison and provided them with replicas of their original weapons and costumes, this was this outfit presented to Calendar Man.\nIt seems fair to say that the Calendar Man committed felonies for reasons beyond pure profit. He was a thrill-seeker who got as much pleasure out of designing theme costumes (an incredible SIXTEEN in his first three crime sprees) and developing weapons (utilizing wind machines, lasers, sonic weaponry and customized motorcycles) and matching wits with Batman. He  even had his own above-ground version of the Batcave, a veritable shrine to the timetable—calendar carpeting, a giant calendar rolodex, massive calendars hanging on the wall, ancient stone timepieces and calendar floor tiles. The Calendar Man committed his first crime on a Monday morning in March, when the Gotham City Planetarium was invaded by a man from the moon, complete with a spherical lunar craft whose magnetic field sent the guards hovering helplessly in the air. After helping himself to \"stamps which had been hand-cancelled by the astronauts during one of the lunar visits,\" the man with the round, cratered headgear and spacesuit made his exit. The Calendar Man never did anything in a small way.\n  \n\n   The confident Calendar Man placed an ad in the newspaper challenging Batman to stop him. The March 17 edition of the Gotham Gazette noted that an \"anonymous letter promises four successful robberies in four days -- each day to correspond to a season of the year -- plus one extra for a 'fifth season.'\"\n  \n\n   Spring arrived early that year in the form of a man in a flower suit—petals bursting from his collar, leaves functioning as a cape—at Gotham's International Garden Show on the 17th. The Calendar Man's debut was tainted a bit by Batman and Robin's interference but he had invited them, after all. \"Summer\" proved more amenable and he escaped with the proceeds from a March 18 beauty pageant while dressed in a flaming asbestos suit. \"Autumn\" blew in on the 19th courtesy of a wind machine that helped him pull off an armored truck robbery. And completing the cycle, the Calendar Man became a snowman to steal \"ice\" from a diamond show for his March 20 winter showing.\n  \n\n   Having racked up four consecutive failures, Batman was determined to thwart the robbery intended for the mysterious \"fifth season,\" which he deduced must be India's Monsoon Season. Noting that an entertainer with the stage name of Maharajah the Magician was in town for a five-day engagement at the Bijou Theater, the Caped Crusader correctly gambled that this might be his target. Still wearing his magician's tuxedo, the Calendar Man was taken into custody on March 21—the first day of Spring. The crime season had come full circle.\n  \n\n   In 1965 a reprint of Calendar Man's debut was printed in Batman # 176.\n  \n\n   In the new series BATMAN FAMILY, it spotlighted minor rogues, reviving\n   Kite Man\n   ,\n   Signalman\n   ,\n   \n    Blockbuster\n   \n   , a new incarnation of\n   \n    Clayface\n   \n   and, in 1979 the Calendar Man. This time, an impressive array of super-weapons was added to the villain's arsenal while the issue retained the Calendar Man's trademark one-time-only parade of costumes.\n  \n\n   Batman # 312 had found the Calendar Man committing crimes tied to the days of the week. Monday, for instance, was named after the moon, hence the lunar costume and theft. Tuesday, \"named for Tiw, the ancient god of war,\" found Calendar Man in centurian-like garb for his theft of military treasures. And on Wednesday, \"named for Woden -- or Odin -- the Norse god of wisdom,\" the rogue was clad as a Viking when he faced The Batman outside the Metropolitan Museum.\"Calendar Man is playing this farce to the hilt,\" he observed. \"His cycle even has eight wheels to emulate Odin's eight-legged horse, Sleipnir.\"\n  \n\n   Calling the Dark Knight's attention crimson monocle, the Calendar Man shouted that \"Odin sacrificed an EYE to gain knowledge -- but I sacrificed MINE to gain POWER!!\" A laser from the eye-piece blasted Batman from his Whirly-Bat and the rogue ultimately made his escape. While playing Thor on Thursday (and carefully avoiding any similarity to the Marvel version), the would-be \"God of Thunder\" left Batman reeling with an ultrasonic blast from his electronically-lined helmet. Sidelined by damage to his inner ear, the Dark Knight was forced to sit out the Calendar Man's Friday and Saturday robberies. For Saturday, he looked akin to the Roman god Saturn and robbed a garden party while trapping victims in a ring-emitting gun (also a play on the planet named after the god). Friday's robbery was Calendar Man dressed in a Scandanavian outfit meant to honor Frigga, the Norse goddess of love, whereupon he stormed a high society wedding and made off with a fortune in silver and jewelry.\n  \n\n   Sunday was a day of rest, and Batman realized late in the game that his foe would regard it as \"the perfect time for you to skip town with what you've stolen --and what more appropriate means of transportation that the Western SUN Express ?\" The civilian-clad Calendar Man took refuge in a train tunnel, taking time to switch to his new red and white costume before resuming his flight. Batman threw a Batarang, to which Calendar Man retorted it missed him. However, Batman's target was not Calendar Man directly, but a railroad signal which the Batarang caused the flag to extend and hit Calendar Man, thus knocking him over and thwarting him. Batman smiles as he remarks \"Calendar Man, you have had a busy week, but you will have 20 years to life to recover from it!\"\n  \n\n   Round three got underway in 1985 when a confederacy of Gotham mobsters put a bounty on The Batman's head and, using the Monitor as an intermediary, hired the Calendar Man to kill him. To Julian Day, it was an agonizing decision. \"I've never murdered ANYONE, nor do I DESIRE to bloody my hands -- yet the very calendar itself is BASED on death and rebirth, Autumn to Spring.\"\n  \n\n   Questioning his hesitation, he asked himself, \"Could it be that I commit my crimes for reasons OTHER than monetary gain ? Could it be that I derive pleasure from passing my time in challenges of wit and skill ? Could it be that the crime of murder is too mundane, too artless, to satisfy my needs ? Could it be that I actually RESPECT The Batman and LOOK FORWARD to our periodic tests ? Of COURSE it could.

The original episodes, produced by Bruce Timm and\n   Eric Radomski\n   , were first aired on the Fox Network from 1992 to 1995. When the first season of the series aired on weekday afternoons, it lacked an on-screen title in the opening credits and was known only as\n   \n\n     Batman\n    \n\n   (and would be referred to as such in episode recaps that summarized what had happened \"previously on\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   ...\") When its timeslot was moved to weekends for the second series, it was named\n   \n\n     The Adventures of Batman & Robin\n    \n\n   , a title originally used in the 1969-1970 animated series created by Filmation, to emphasize the crime fighting partnership of the characters and allow younger audiences to become more familiar with\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   , who would shortly afterwards feature in the 1995 film\n   \n\n     Batman Forever\n    \n\n   .\n  \n\n   The series was the first of what fans refer to as the DC Animated Universe (DCAU), a shared continuity of Batman shows throughout the 1990s culminating in a Justice League cartoon in the early 2000s.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Overview\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Creation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Acclaim\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n\n          The New Batman Adventures\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Influence\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.1\n        \n\n         New characters\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.2\n        \n\n         Bruce Wayne\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Bat Equipment\n      \n\n\n\n\n      4\n     \n\n      Episodes\n     \n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n         Lost episode\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Theatrical and direct-to-video releases\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Cast\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.1\n        \n\n         Main Protagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.2\n        \n\n         Supporting protagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.3\n        \n\n         Main antagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.4\n        \n\n         Supporting antagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Videos\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Overview\n   \n\n\n\n    Creation\n   \n\n\n   The original series was partially inspired by\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 blockbuster\n   \n\n     Batman\n    \n\n   film and the acclaimed Superman cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios in the 1940s. Timm and Radomski designed the series by closely emulating the Tim Burton films' \"otherworldly timelessness,\" incorporating period features such as black-and-white title cards, police blimps, 40s influenced fashion, 40s influenced car styling and a \"vintage\" color scheme in a largely film noir-influenced style. The series initially took as its theme a variation of music written by\n   \n    Danny Elfman\n   \n   for Burton's Batman film; later episodes of the series used a new theme with a similar style by Shirley Walker. The score of the series was influenced by Elfman and Walker's work on\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   and\n   \n\n     Batman Returns\n    \n\n   and the music of 40s film noir. The art style of the original animated series was also partially a reaction against the realism seen in shows like\n   \n    X-Men\n   \n   ; the second series in some ways was a further extension of that rejection of realism.\n  \n\n   Like\n   \n    X-Men\n   \n   , the program was much more adult oriented than previous typical superhero cartoon series. In their constant quest to make the show darker, the producers pushed the boundaries of action cartoons: it was the first such cartoon in years to depict firearms being fired instead of laser guns (only one person has ever been actually depicted as shot;\n   Commissioner Gordon\n   in episode 49 was seen to have a gunshot wound after the firefight was finished), Batman actually punching and kicking the antagonists, as well as the existence of blood (such as Batman having a trail of blood from his mouth); in addition, many of the series' backgrounds were painted on black paper. The distinctive visual combination of film noir imagery and Art Deco designs with a very dark color scheme was called \"Dark Deco\" by the producers. First-time producers Timm and Radomski reportedly encountered resistance from studio executives, but the success of Burton's first film allowed the embryonic series to survive long enough to produce a pilot episode, \"\n   On Leather Wings\n   \", which according to Timm \"got a lot of people off our backs.\"\n  \n\n\n    Acclaim\n   \n\n\n   The Emmy Award-winning series quickly received wide acclaim for its distinctive animation and mature writing, and it instantly became a hit. Fans of a wide age range praised the show's sophisticated, cinematic tone, character depth and psychological stories. Voice-actor\n   Kevin Conroy\n   used two distinct voices to portray Bruce Wayne and Batman, as\n   \n    Michael Keaton\n   \n   had done in the films. This series also featured a supporting cast that included major actors performing the voices of the various classic villains, most notably\n   Mark Hamill\n   , who defined a whole new career for himself in animation with his portrayal of\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   . The voice recording sessions were recorded with the actors together in a studio, like a radio play, unlike most animated films, in which the principal voice actors record separately and never meet (various interviews have noted that such an arrangement (having the cast record together) was a benefit to the show as a whole, as the actors were able to 'react' to one another, rather than simply 'reading the words').\n  \n\n   Key to the series' artistic success is that it managed to redefine classic characters, paying homage to their previous portrayals while giving them new dramatic force. The characterization of villains such as\n   \n    Two-Face\n   \n   and the\n   Mad Hatter\n   and heroes like\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   (who had not appeared in the Burton film series) demonstrate this.\n   The Penguin\n   is based upon his appearance in\n   \n    Batman Returns\n   \n   , which was being released at the same time as the series. The series also gave new life to nearly forgotten characters like the\n   Clock King\n   . An often noted example of dramatic change is\n   \n    Mr. Freeze\n   \n   ;\n   \n    Batman: TAS\n   \n   turned him from a clichéd mad scientist with a gimmick for cold, to a tragic figure whose frigid exterior hides a doomed love and a cold vindictive fury. Part of the tragedy is mimicked later in the plot of\n   \n    Joel Schumacher\n   \n   's live action movie\n   \n\n     Batman & Robin\n    \n\n   , although much of the drama was lost with the resurrection of the pun-quipping mad scientist image. Another example of dramatic change is\n   Clayface\n   , a character who to fans is believed to be far more intriguing to an audience due to his tragic past and almost 'sane' way of dealing with situations, and later influenced DC to recreate their version of the character to fit the animated universes. The most famous of the series' innovations is the Joker's hapless assistant,\n   Harley Quinn\n   , who became so popular that DC Comics later added her to the mainstream Batman comic continuity.\n  \n\n   This series became a cornerstone of the Warner Bros.' animation department, which became one of the top producers of television animation. For years, Warner Bros. Animation had been known only for doing Looney Tunes and their offshoots such as\n   \n    Tiny Toon Adventures\n   \n   . This was Warner's first attempt at doing a serious animated cartoon and it ended up working better than they thought. It also sparked a large franchise of similar TV adaptations of DC Comics characters. Despite the marketing decision by Warner Bros. of making the series a Saturday morning cartoon, Producer Bruce Timm and the crew were not interested in making a show aimed squarely at small children.\n  \n\n\n\n\n      The New Batman Adventures\n     \n\n\n\n\n   A completely new version of the series was launched to match the more efficient animation style of\n   \n    Superman: The Animated Series\n   \n   . It also opened up possibilities for crossovers. All characters, vehicles and props were redesigned, with the exception of\n   \n    Two-Face\n   \n   .\n   \n\n     The New Batman Adventures\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n\n     Batman Beyond\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Justice League\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Justice League Unlimited\n    \n\n   all form a continuity that fans refer to as the \"DC Animated Universe.\"\n  \n\n\n    Influence\n   \n\n\n\n    New characters\n   \n\n\n   New villains like\n   Red Claw\n   , the ninja\n   Kyodai Ken\n   , and the\n   Sewer King\n   were invented for the series, but to little acclaim. From the episode \"\n   Tyger, Tyger\n   \" another character named\n   Tygrus\n   was created, whose story was probably inspired by the H.G.

    "question": "Batman",
    "response": "Batman is a iconic superhero created by DC Comics, owned by Warner Bros., and is the alter ego of Bruce Wayne, a billionaire philanthropist from Gotham City. Here's a concise overview based on the available information:\n\n- **Origins and Role**: Bruce Wayne witnessed the tragic murder of his parents as a child, which fueled his vow to combat crime. As an adult, he becomes Batman, a masked vigilante who operates in Gotham City, using his wealth from Wayne Enterprises to fund his crusade against injustice. He serves as a symbol of hope and a founding member of the Justice League, embodying themes of loss, justice, and heroism through his relentless fight against corruption.\n\n- **Key Abilities**: Batman relies on human skills rather than superpowers. He is a master acrobat with excellent gymnastics, and he maintains peak human conditioning through intense training, making him stronger, faster, and more agile than most. He uses advanced technology, including a utility belt with gadgets, vehicles like the Batmobile, and various Batsuits for protection and mobility.\n\n- **Major Adversaries**: Batman faces a rogues gallery of villains, including the Joker (his chaotic arch-nemesis), Bane (a powerful mercenary), Penguin, Man-Bat, Killer Croc, and Clayface. These foes often represent chaos, greed, and personal demons, highlighting themes of psychological struggle and the complexity of heroism.\n\n- **Appearances in Media**: Batman has appeared in numerous films, TV series, and comics. Notable films include \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\" (1993), \"Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero\" (1998), and \"Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker\" (2000). TV series include \"Batman: The Animated Series\" (1992-1995), \"The New Batman Adventures\" (1997-1999), and \"Batman Beyond\" (1999-2001). In comics, writer Doug Moench contributed extensively, such as in \"Detective Comics\" and \"Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight,\" exploring Batman's world in depth.\n\nThis character reflects broader themes in popular culture, such as how personal tragedy can inspire heroism and the moral ambiguities of vigilantism. For deeper exploration, I suggest checking out DC Comics resources or watching \"Batman: The Animated Series\" as a starting point. What specific aspect of Batman would you like to learn more about next?",

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City.

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights.

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots.\n  \n\n\n    Powers and Abilities\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Master Acrobat:\n    \n    Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.\n   \n\n\n     Peak Human Conditioning:\n    \n    Through intense training, Batman represents the pinnacle of human physical potential.

It made its first appearance in\n   \n    Detective Comics #60\n   \n   , February 1942.\n  \n\n   In the comic's post-Crisis continuity, the signal was introduced after the Batman's first encounter against\n   \n    the Joker\n   \n   (not unlike the first movie) in\n   \n    Batman: The Man Who Laughs\n   \n   ; in Batman and the\n   Mad Monk\n   , Gordon initially used a pager, but during a meeting with Batman he threw it away, saying that he couldn't sneak around in the shadows like Batman and wanted a more above-board means of contacting him.\n  \n\n\n    Used by Others\n   \n\n\n   Others have used the Bat-Signal for their own purposes.\n  \n\n   In the \"Lovers and Madmen\" story arc from\n   \n    Batman Confidential\n   \n   , which retells the origin of the Joker and his first encounter with Batman, Batman sees the Bat-Signal for the first time and assumes that Gordon created it to ask for his help in battling the Joker. When he reaches the rooftop, however, he finds that the Joker actually created it, and used it to force a confrontation with Batman.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n    Detective Comics\n   \n   #466 (1976), the villainous\n   Signalman\n   manages to trap the Batman inside the Bat-Signal device.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n    Legends of the Dark Knight\n   \n   #6, a cadre of crime bosses projects the signal upside down in order to summon Batman to help them fight a killer they can't defeat. In the Halloween special comic series,\n   \n    Haunted Knight\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Scarecrow\n   \n   alters the Bat-Signal to notify Batman that he has kidnapped then-Captain Jim Gordon. By adding an orange bulb and painting \"eyes\" on the signal, he turns the beam into a stylized Jack-o'-lantern image (with the bat symbol forming the mouth beneath two eyes).\n  \n\n   In\n   \n    Batman: Dark Victory\n   \n   ,\n   Hangman\n   sneaks onto the roof of Police Headquarters and turns the Bat-Signal on to lure then-recently appointed Commissioner James Gordon to the roof and try to kill him, but is thwarted when\n   \n    Two-Face\n   \n   cuts Gordon down.\n  \n\n   Near the beginning of the\n   \n    Batman: No Man's Land\n   \n   story arc, a junior officer creates an improvised Bat-Signal out of spare parts. Gordon smashes it to pieces as he is angry that Batman hasn't shown up. Oracle also builds a small Bat-Signal to summon Batman to talk to her after having seen\n   \n    Huntress\n   \n   wearing a Batgirl costume.\n  \n\n   In the comic book series\n   \n    Gotham Central\n   \n   , the purpose of the Bat-Signal is further expanded upon; as Batman's existence is not officially recognized by the Gotham City authorities, the Bat-Signal is explained as a method of using the \"urban legend\" around Batman to terrify Gotham's criminal underworld.\n  \n\n   As official proven police interaction with the Bat-Signal and Batman himself can lead to cases against criminals arrested by Batman being dismissed, it is up to the civilian employees of the Gotham police department (including the Major Case Squad's civilian attache, Stacy) to operate the signal officially. Owing to the events in the \"War Crimes\" storyline, relations between Batman and the\n   \n    Gotham City Police Department\n   \n   under Commissioner Michael Akins are officially severed; the Bat-Signal is removed from the roof of Gotham Central. Needing Batman's help on an extraordinary case, Akins brings out a spare bat signal for a single use.\n  \n\n   This signal is a more sophisticated laser which paints a green bat symbol in the clouds and is apparently more visible. This version of the signal is donated by Kord Industries (see the\n   Blue Beetle\n   ). The laser signal is said to have been unused because the city council deems it an \"inappropriate gift.\" (The characters are notably unimpressed by the more high tech version.)\n  \n\n   In the\n   \n    52\n   \n   series,\n   The Question\n   alters the traditional Bat-Signal to project a spray-painted question mark. In the\n   \n    One Year Later\n   \n   series, however, with the re-installation of James Gordon as commissioner, relations with Batman appear to have thawed; upon Batman's return from one year of self-imposed exile, the Bat-Signal (restored to the roof of police headquarters) is activated once again. The familiar sight of the Bat symbol in the sky prompts cheers from most of the citizens of Gotham.\n  \n\n\n    In Other Media\n   \n\n\n\n    Columbia serials\n   \n\n\n   In the 1943 serial, Batsignals are projected in the \"Bat's Cave\" and by\n   Batman\n   using a flashlight.\n   Police Captain Arnold\n   does not use it to contact him.\n  \n\n   In the 1949 serial, Commissioner Gordon uses a modest sized Batsignal projector through the window of his office.\n  \n\n\n    Television\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Batman\n    \n    (1960s series)\n   \n\n\n   The Batsignal was rarely used in the live-action television series because the Commissioner usually contacted\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   in the daytime with his\n   Batphone\n   , in a radical departure from the comics.\n  \n\n   In the\n   \n    1966 movie\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   asked\n   Commissioner Gordon\n   to get Chief O'Hara to activate it as a distraction so that the criminals would think that they were headed for Police Headquarters.\n  \n\n   The Bat symbol in the sky was also used in the end credits of every episode and was seen on the access menu of the special edition DVD release of the film.\n  \n\n\n    DC Animated Universe\n   \n\n\n   In\n   \n    Batman: The Animated Series\n   \n   , the Batsignal first appears in \"\n   Joker's Favor\n   \", where\n   Charlie Collins\n   improvises it to get\n   \n    Batman's\n   \n   attention. The Signal itself first appears in \"\n   The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy\n   \", with it being used by\n   Gordon\n   and the GCPD throughout the series.\n   \n    Barbara Gordon\n   \n   also used the Bat-Signal to contact Batman in \"\n   Heart of Steel Part II\n   \", with it later being destroyed during a fight between them and a\n   HARDAC\n   duplicate of\n   Harvey Bullock\n   . Likewise, the real Harvey Bullock used the Batsignal for the first time when he reluctantly asked for Batman's help in discovering who tried to kill him in \"\n   A Bullet for Bullock\n   \".\n  \n\n   In the film\n   \n    Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\n   \n   ,\n   Arthur Reeves\n   and the GCPD, believing Batman had murdered several gang lords, attempt to use the Batsignal to lure him into a trap. However, he knew of the ploy and did not respond.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n\n     Batman Beyond\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n    Paxton Power\n   \n   uses the Batsignal to summon\n   Terry McGinnis\n   to help locate\n   his father\n   in \"\n   \n    Ascension\n   \n   \". Upon arriving, Batman destroyed the Batsignal, suggesting he used \"email\".\n  \n\n\n    Film\n   \n\n\n\n    Motion Picture Anthology\n   \n\n\n   In\n   \n\n     Batman\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   gave the Batsignal to the\n   GCPD\n   after the death of the\n   Joker\n   as a gift so that when he was needed, they could summon him. Originally the Batsignal was going to be projected onto the side of\n   a building\n   like the more realistic version seen in the\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   . When the ending was reshot, a more traditional use of the signal into the sky was used.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n\n     Batman Returns\n    \n\n   , Bruce had automated mirrors stationed up around the top of\n   Wayne Manor\n   that would reflect the signal directly through the window of his study. It was seen when Commissioner Gordon needed his help when the\n   \n    Red Triangle Gang\n   \n   attacked\n   Gotham Plaza\n   during the the initial\n   Lighting of the Tree Ceremony\n   .\n  \n\n   Much like the first film, the",

After a breakdown in negation regarding the script, Val Kilmer chose not to return.\n   George Clooney\n   took over the role of Batman while Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as Robin/Dick Grayson.

A animated home video tie-tin,\n   \n    Batman: Gotham Knight\n   \n   was released to promote the film.

This prompted them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a fifth film, but writer\n   Akiva Goldsman\n   , who worked on\n   \n    Batman Forever\n   \n   and\n   \n    Batman & Robin\n   \n   with Schumacher, turned down the chance to write the script. In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired\n   Mark Protosevich\n   to write the script for a fifth\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced. Titled\n   \n    Batman Unchained\n   \n   , Protosevich's script had the\n   \n    Scarecrow\n   \n   as the main villain and it would bring back the franchise in a more serious and darker direction, unlike the previous two films.\n  \n\n   The script dealt with Batman learning to conquer fear and to confront the demons of his past.\n   \n    The Joker\n   \n   would return as a hallucination in Batman's mind caused by the Scarecrow's fear toxin, along with\n   \n    Penguin\n   \n   ,\n   Catwoman\n   ,\n   \n    Two-Face\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Riddler\n   \n   , all together to judge the hero on trial.\n   \n    Harley Quinn\n   \n   appeared as a toymaker, written as the Joker's daughter trying to get revenge on Batman for the Joker's death. Crane discovers Batman's identity and forms an alliance with Harley to lead him to madness and lock him in\n   Arkham Asylum\n   .\n  \n\n   In the script, Robin abandons Batman for disagreements, but he returns during the final battle to help his mentor. After defeating his enemies and his demons, Bruce makes a trip to Bali and enters a cave full of bats, with them flying around him, as a proof for having conquered his fears.\n  \n\n   George Clooney\n   and\n   Chris O'Donnell\n   were set to reprise the roles of\n   Batman\n   and\n   Robin\n   , respectively.\n  \n\n   Schumacher offered the part of the Scarecrow to Nicolas Cage while filming\n   \n    Face/Off\n   \n   and Courtney Love was proposed for the role of Harley.\n  \n\n   However, when\n   \n    Batman & Robin\n   \n   received negative reviews and failed to outgross any of its predecessors on its release, the idea was to continue the big budget spectacle but Warner Bros. were unsure of their plans for\n   \n    Batman Unchained\n   \n   and George Clooney vowed never to wear the cape and cowl again. Director of the previous two films\n   Joel Schumacher\n   claimed that he turned down the chance to return stating that he lost his \"passion\" for Batman in film and didn't want to turn the passion into just a job. In reality it seemed the studio was unwilling to to gamble on his vision.\n  \n\n   In the aftermath producer\n   Peter MacGregor-Scott\n   was relegated to making\n   OnStar\n   commercials featuring\n   Bruce Thomas\n   as\n   Batman\n   . Surviving costume pieces like\n   Clooney's Batsuit\n   and\n   Kilmer's Cowl\n   as well as the Batcave set were re-used in the television spots. The studio favored bringing back the\n   Michael Keaton\n   Batmobile\n   and\n   Danny Elfman\n   theme\n   to distance them from the Schumacher ephemera.\n  \n\n\n    Impact on further screenplays\n   \n\n\n   WB executive Greg Silverman was tasked with helping develop a new script featuring Scarecrow by Lee Shapiro and Stephen Wise, called\n   \n    Batman: DarKnight\n   \n   . The new approach to a fifth movie focused on more physiological nuance and building a more subtle dark atmosphere, keeping the budget more reasonable to address criticisms of the previous movie. Ultimately the studio decided it was best to consider something completely different rather a fifth sequel.\n  \n\n   A live-action\n   \n\n     Batman Beyond\n    \n\n   film and an adaptation of\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n\n     Batman: Year One\n    \n\n   were both developed. Warner Bros. would hire\n   Darren Aronofsky\n   to direct\n   \n    Year One\n   \n   . Realizing it had deviated so far from the source material it was abandoned as well.\n   \n    Christopher Nolan\n   \n   pitched a similar take in 2003 which resulted in\n   \n    Batman Begins\n   \n   , the final film features numerous influences from both scripts for the fifth movie using Scarecrow.\n  \n\n\n    Trivia\n   \n\n\n\n    The 2015 video game\n    \n\n      Batman: Arkham Knight\n     \n\n    seems to indirectly draw some inspiration from the unused script to\n    \n     Batman Unchained\n    \n    , as the game features\n    Scarecrow\n    as the main villain and the\n    \n     Joker\n    \n    appearing to\n    Batman\n    in hallucinations.\n   \n\n\n\n    DC Movies Wikia Page\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist\n   \n    Bob Kane\n   \n   and writer\n   \n    Bill Finger\n   \n   . The character made his first appearance in\n   \n\n     Detective Comics\n    \n    #27\n   \n   (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of\n   \n    Bruce Wayne\n   \n   . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , beneath\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   assisted by his butler\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   .

This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.

In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends.

Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   .

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist\n   \n    Bob Kane\n   \n   and writer\n   \n    Bill Finger\n   \n   . The character made his first appearance in\n   \n\n     Detective Comics\n    \n    #27\n   \n   (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of\n   \n    Bruce Wayne\n   \n   . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , beneath\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   assisted by his butler\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   . That and the success of director\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character.

His personal favourite was the\n   Gray Ghost\n   , watching the television show with his father.\n  \n\n   On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to\n   \n    Wonder Woman\n   \n   , Bruce hadn't been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes' faithful friend and butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n  \n\n   Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from\n   \n    Yoru Sensei\n   \n   . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor's daughter\n   \n    Zatanna\n   \n   became very close.\n  \n\n   As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with\n   \n    Andrea Beaumont\n   \n   . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\".\n  \n\n\n    War on Crime\n   \n\n\n   Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city's underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   as his ward after witnessing his parents' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down\n   their murderer\n   . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and\n   Commissioner James Gordon\n   , working with them to control crime in Gotham.\n  \n\n   Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Poison Ivy\n   ,\n   \n    Mr. Freeze\n   \n   and\n   the Scarecrow\n   . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including\n   Catwoman\n   and\n   Two-Face\n   . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered\n   \n    the Joker\n   \n   , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created.\n  \n\n\n    New Adventures\n   \n\n\n   Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as\n   \n    Batwoman\n   \n   . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father's legacy as the next Police Commissioner.\n  \n\n   Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned\n   Tim Drake\n   from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder.\n  \n\n\n    Joining Up\n   \n\n\n   For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called\n   Blüdhaven\n   .\n  \n\n   Batman would later find himself in\n   Metropolis\n   , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with\n   \n    Lex Luthor\n   \n   , Batman would find himself working with\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker's plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue's gallery.\n  \n\n   He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another's home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity.\n  \n\n   Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper.\n  \n\n   It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world's greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League.\n  \n\n\n    Saving the World\n   \n\n\n   Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech's deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station's antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J'onn J'onzz' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna's destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch.\n  \n\n   Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman's mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don't even think about it\".\n  \n\n   When the Imperium's attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation.\n  \n\n   Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J'onn J'onzz. After freeing J'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J'onn J'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of\n   \n    Wonder Woman\n   \n   .\n   \n    The Flash\n   \n   arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing's severed wing. After J'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium's invasion of\n   \n    Mars\n   \n   , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium's factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun's rays.\n  \n\n   The heroes spl \n\n\n\n\n\n    This page is about the original comic book character.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist\n   \n    Bob Kane\n   \n   and writer\n   \n    Bill Finger\n   \n   . The character made his first appearance in\n   \n\n     Detective Comics\n    \n    #27\n   \n   (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of\n   \n    Bruce Wayne\n   \n   . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , beneath\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   assisted by his butler\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   . That and the success of director\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World's Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       History\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n\n          Early Life\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Golden Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Silver Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Modern Batman\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Knightfall\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Batman R.I.P.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.7\n        \n\n         \"Death\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.8\n        \n\n         Return\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.9\n        \n\n         New 52\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.10\n        \n\n         DC Rebirth\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.11\n        \n\n         The Joker War\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.12\n        \n\n         Infinite Frontier\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Personality\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Relationships\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Family\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Romances\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Allies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.4\n        \n\n         Enemies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Abilities\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Paraphernalia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Equipment\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           5.1.1\n          \n\n           Former Equipment\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Weapons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Transportation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Other Media\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Notes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    History\n   \n\n\n\n    For key points in Batman's history see\n    Batman's publication history\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Early Life\n    \n\n\n\n   Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable\n   \n    Gotham City\n   \n   socialites. Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named\n   \n    Joe Chill\n   \n   . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives.\n  \n\n   As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   . He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.\n  \n\n\n    Modern Batman\n   \n\n\n   After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics rebooted the stories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences.\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   retold Batman's origin in the storyline\n   \n    Year One\n   \n   from Batman #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.

    "response": "No, Batman does not have real wings. In the stories from the context, Batman is a human character, Bruce Wayne, who relies on his intelligence, physical training, and high-tech gadgets to fight crime, rather than any supernatural or biological features like actual wings. For example, he might use devices such as the Bat-Glider or Batplane for flying, but these are man-made tools he invented or acquired through his resources at Wayne Enterprises. This is different from characters who might have innate abilities, like wings, which are part of their body or powers.

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots.\n  \n\n\n    Powers and Abilities\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Master Acrobat:\n    \n    Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.\n   \n\n\n     Peak Human Conditioning:\n    \n    Through intense training, Batman represents the pinnacle of human physical potential.

Batwing, The Batman of Africa was created by writer Grant Morrison and first depicted by artist Yanick Paquette. He first appeared in the fifth issue of Batman, Incorporated. According to fellow Batman, Incorporated artist, Chris Burnham told iFanboy that he designed the character first, while Paquette was the first to draw him in interiors. In line with Morrison's use of obscure continuity throughout his Batman stories, the character seems to be based visually on a minor character which appeared in\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   #250\n   in a story called \"The Batman Nobody Knows\". In this story, a young African-American boy tells his friends how he imagines Batman to be, and gives him the name \"Batwings\".\n  \n\n   When David Zavimbe was a young boy in Tinasha, a fictional city within the Democratic Republic of Congo, his parents died of HIV/AIDS very early in his life. Following the death of his parents, he was drafted as a boy soldier, like many children his age, into a war that ravaged his country. David was able to escape the life of being a soldier at such a young age, and soon became a police officer in Tinasha, where despite corruption running rampant, he remained dedicated to the law and justice. Elsewhere in the United States, Bruce Wayne announces Batman Incorporated, an initiative to put Batman like figures in countries all across the world.\n  \n\n   Soon after that, Batman pays a visit to Tinasha, where he inducts David as the newest member of his team in his quest to stop the global terrorists, Leviathan. Shortly after finding the false Dr. Dedalus and coming into confrontation with Leviathan yet again, Batman travels to an unknown destination within the continent of Africa to recruit a new member to his team of Batmen, Batman Incorporated. Batman leads David through his first mission for Batman Incorporated, providing a technologically advanced bat-suit. David comes into contact with a Leviathan brain-washing cell, narrowly avoiding escape once his presence is compromised. During his escape, he demonstrated a knowledge of martial arts, also showing off special capabilities of his bat-suit including jet propulsion.\n  \n\n   Batwing faces off against a new villain calling himself Massacre. As Massacre gets the upper hand in battle against Batwing we see a flashback of Batwing stopping Blood Tiger, a former captain of a warlord and now in control of a drug ring. With the help of Batman he manages to capture him.\n  \n\n   As he further investigates he comes upon a gruesome crime scene with beheaded bodies.

His personal favourite was the\n   Gray Ghost\n   , watching the television show with his father.\n  \n\n   On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to\n   \n    Wonder Woman\n   \n   , Bruce hadn't been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes' faithful friend and butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n  \n\n   Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from\n   \n    Yoru Sensei\n   \n   . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor's daughter\n   \n    Zatanna\n   \n   became very close.\n  \n\n   As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with\n   \n    Andrea Beaumont\n   \n   . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\".\n  \n\n\n    War on Crime\n   \n\n\n   Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city's underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   as his ward after witnessing his parents' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down\n   their murderer\n   . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and\n   Commissioner James Gordon\n   , working with them to control crime in Gotham.\n  \n\n   Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Poison Ivy\n   ,\n   \n    Mr. Freeze\n   \n   and\n   the Scarecrow\n   . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including\n   Catwoman\n   and\n   Two-Face\n   . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered\n   \n    the Joker\n   \n   , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created.\n  \n\n\n    New Adventures\n   \n\n\n   Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as\n   \n    Batwoman\n   \n   . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father's legacy as the next Police Commissioner.\n  \n\n   Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned\n   Tim Drake\n   from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder.\n  \n\n\n    Joining Up\n   \n\n\n   For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called\n   Blüdhaven\n   .\n  \n\n   Batman would later find himself in\n   Metropolis\n   , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with\n   \n    Lex Luthor\n   \n   , Batman would find himself working with\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker's plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue's gallery.\n  \n\n   He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another's home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity.\n  \n\n   Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper.\n  \n\n   It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world's greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League.\n  \n\n\n    Saving the World\n   \n\n\n   Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech's deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station's antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J'onn J'onzz' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna's destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch.\n  \n\n   Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman's mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don't even think about it\".\n  \n\n   When the Imperium's attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation.\n  \n\n   Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J'onn J'onzz. After freeing J'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J'onn J'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of\n   \n    Wonder Woman\n   \n   .\n   \n    The Flash\n   \n   arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing's severed wing. After J'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium's invasion of\n   \n    Mars\n   \n   , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium's factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun's rays.\n  \n\n   The heroes spl",

    "question": "what is the batmobile?",
    "response": "The Batmobile is Batman's iconic custom automobile, serving as his primary mode of transportation in the Batman universe. It first appeared in DC Comics in 1941, specifically in *Detective Comics* #48, and has evolved significantly over the years, reflecting changes in Batman's stories across comics, TV shows, films, and other media.\n\n**Historical Evolution:** Early designs were based on real cars like the 1936 Cord, starting as a red convertible without a bat mask. By the 1950s, it featured a \"bubble dome\" for simplicity, and in the 1960s, it became the sleek, finned vehicle popularized in the Adam West TV series. Later versions, such as those in the 1970s and 1980s comics, shifted to more practical or armored designs, like a two-seat coupé with gadgets for urban combat. In modern adaptations, it has grown into high-tech vehicles, including ones capable of flight in recent Batman comics and films.\n\n**Design Features and Gadgets:** The Batmobile is equipped with an array of advanced features, such as bulletproof armor, smoke screens, missiles, radar, and a crime lab. It often includes hydraulic impact absorbers, remote driving systems, and even voice-activated controls. Designs vary by era—for example, the 1966 TV series version had a bat-themed grill and fins, while later ones emphasize speed, durability, and tech like AI guidance or hybrid engines.\n\n**Cultural Impact:** As a pop culture icon, the Batmobile symbolizes Batman's ingenuity and has appeared in numerous adaptations, including the 1966 Batman TV series, films like *Batman: The Movie*, and animated shows like *Batman: The Animated Series*. It represents narrative devices in storytelling, such as innovation in crime-fighting and the evolution of superhero vehicles, influencing toys, video games, and merchandise. This enduring presence has made it a beloved symbol of Batman's world, inspiring fans and contributing to the broader appeal of superhero lore.\n\nFor more details, you can explore specific Batman media, but this gives a solid overview!",

Most of the design was based on the 1936 Cord, though the nose of the car looked more like that of a Lincoln or similar car. The bat mask did not exist yet, but the car did sport a small \"bat\" hood ornament.\n  \n\n   Several \"Proto-Batmobiles\" had appeared in comics by this point, though this was the first to use the name. It was also the last car used before the now famous Batmobiles with the bat-masks and roof fins.\n  \n\n   Though very similar in design to the 1941 car, the progression of the 1950s saw the Batmobile change again for the sake artistic simplicity; hence, the \"bubble dome\" Batmobile was created.\n  \n\n   It retains many of the features of the previous car, with the major exception being the now separate dome over the passenger compartment. The car has also lost many of the curves of the previous car, being essentially a very long, thin box with the dome, fin, and \"bat nose\" features added. The on-board laboratory was lost, leaving only a two-passenger compartment under the dome. Many Batmobile fans dislike the overly simplified lines of this car, which would last until the next redesign came in the early 1960s.\n  \n\n   Another variation of the \"Futura Batmobile\" appeared in\n   \n    Detective Comics\n   \n   #374, used as Batman tracked down a criminal who nearly killed\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   . Although much of the design followed the standard comic version of the Futura, a few details have been changed. These included wider rockers, larger fins, and, most notably, a separate Bat Mask been added to the nose of the car between the grille openings. 1969 saw big changes in Batman's world. Dick had moved away to go to\n   Hudson University\n   , Bruce and Alfred had locked up Wayne Manor and moved to a penthouse in the heart of Gotham, and the larger-than-life Batmobile became a thing of the past.\n  \n\n   In its place was a two-seat coupé outfitted with a turbocharged engine, bulletproof chassis and body panels, hydraulic impact absorbers built into the front end, and a smokescreen generator. To retain a low profile, it had bulletproof one-way mirrored windows and diplomatic license plates. It also represented two Batmobile firsts: gull-wing doors and a remote driving system. The latter was originally developed as a safety measure to get Batman out of tight situations, but was found to be equally effective acting as a decoy and has since appeared in several Batmobiles since then.\n  \n\n   Although it is referred to as a \"nondescript\" design, the yellow-striped paint job and roof accessory still retained a bit of the previous Batmobiles' bravado.\n  \n\n   A variation of the 1970 Batmobile appeared in\n   \n\n     Detective Comics\n    \n\n   #449. This version was much larger than the sports cars generally used in the 1970s, and looks more like a full-sized car. The only \"gadget\" used in this particular car is a police radio, which Batman used to keep in touch with\n   \n    Jim Gordon\n   \n   and his officers during a cattle stampede.\n  \n\n\n    Ernie Chan\n   \n   further developed the roadster in\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   #278 by adding a recessed rear window and bringing the roll bar up to the same height as the windshield. The result was a car not unlike the Corvette roadsters of the late 1960s/early 1970s. The \"cape\" across the rear deck remained, as did the small headlights and yellow oval bat emblem on the hood. It's use in the issue is primarily limited to transportation for Batman and Inspector\n   \n    Clive Kittridge\n   \n   , though an early scene in the comic demonstrates the Batmobile's tough armor plating when it easily shrugs off a collision with a hijacked cargo truck.\n  \n\n   In mid-1985, a special variation of the standard Batmobile appeared in both Batman and Detective Comics. Based on the popular\n   \n    Super Powers Batmobile\n   \n   , this design had a full set of front and rear canopies, \"Coke-bottle\" sides, integrated fins, and generally rounder features, just like the toy. The only difference between this car and its toy counterpart is the nose, which was occasionally drawn longer and more pointed.\n  \n\n   In the 1988 storyline \"The Cult,\" Batman faced a new enemy named\n   Deacon Blackfire\n   . As the Deacon created an army from Gotham City's homeless population, he was able to kidnap and brainwash Batman into joining his side. Tortured, starved, and drugged, Batman (with the help of Robin) eventually managed to flee Gotham City as the Deacon declared it his own kingdom. The duo returned a week later to retake Gotham, using an all-new Batmobile.\n  \n\n   Borrowing elements from\n   \n\n     Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\n    \n\n   , this Batmobile was a behemoth. Built as the ultimate urban assault vehicle, it had 15' diameter puncture-proof balloon tires, 4-wheel drive, heavy duty armor plating, radar, missiles, and 200 RPM tranquilizer-firing machine guns. The only traditional Batmobile features that were retained on this vehicle were a pair of small bat fins and the gunners dome, which was designed much like the domes on the Batmobiles of the 1950s.\n  \n\n   This Batmobile made another appearance over a decade later, in the \"\n   \n    Aftershock\n   \n   \" storyline. The heavy-duty 4WD allowed Batman to move through Gotham in the weeks after the earthquake that destroyed much of the city.\n  \n\n   During the Legends of the Dark Knight \"Prey\" storyline, a secondary development showed Batman building his first Batmobile. Early versions of the car (as it was being constructed) suggested a two-passenger design, but the finished vehicle looked more like a jet-powered racing boat than an automobile.\n  \n\n   The car would be used several times over the next few years, but details would change occasionally. For example, the nose changed from twin \"mandibles\" to a smooth curve and back, all in the same issue. No special features or abilities are shown, beyond the heavily-armored body.\n  \n\n   Another Batmobile used the concept of the previous car, but was designed to suit\n   Jean Paul Valley\n   's Batman,after Bruce Wayne had been broken by\n   \n    Bane\n   \n   . The Batmobile now had wide, sweeping fenders, pointed wings, and huge intakes on either side of the canopy. The interior was redesigned as well, into a single-person cockpit. Like the bat suit, many of the car's features were voice-activated.\n  \n\n   Bruce Wayne finally returned to reclaim the mantle of the bat in 1995, and Jean Paul Valley's Batman and Batmobile were retired permanently. The \"mean machine\" Batmobile was phased out in 2000 to make way for a newer, sleeker Batmobile design. This car was similar to the 1962 Batmobile in general appearance, but it had been updated and modernized with smaller fins, a jet engine, full roof, and a true bat-mask grill. The Batmobile's typical arsenal remained, as the car was armor plated, and had such features as self-sealing tires, on-board weapons & weapons-detection systems, a heads-up display, and a retractable roof. In the recent\n   \n    Batman & Robin\n   \n   Series, Dick Grayson, who has taken the role of Batman following Bruce Wayne's supposed death, has now begun using a new Batmobile which is capable of flight.

He has been helping people publicly through the firm he runs called \"The Wayne Foundation,\" and secretly in the guise of Batman, since his parents were killed when he was a young boy. He is an international sportsman, and enjoys potholing, fishing, and falconry. These skills often come in handy when fighting crime. Bruce has many hobbies, such as collecting antlers, stamps, and antique pocket watches.\n  \n\n   Even as a child, Bruce was a skilled individual; when he was 11 years old, he was the Junior Marbles Champion of Gotham City. The one thing he cannot abide is being called a coward. As Bruce Wayne he lived at Wayne Manor with his youthful ward\n   Dick Grayson (Robin)\n   , his butler\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   (although Alfred's surname was never used on the series) and Aunt\n   Harriet Cooper\n   .\n  \n\n   He is extremely moral with people breaking the law, and though he was ready and willing to send criminals such as the Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler to prison, he did show a sense of compassion for the Catwoman, who had a crush on him. But because she refused to give up her life of crime and always wanted Robin out of the way, the Caped Crusader never explored the relationship further.\n  \n\n   He is a great friend of Police Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara, as both identities; but the two men never found out who he really was. He developed a friendship with\n   Batgirl\n   , who helped him and Robin fight crime; however, unlike Wayne Manor's majordomo, he did not learn that she was really the Commissioner's daughter Barbara.\n  \n\n   Batman was always willing to put others first before himself and often helped Robin while on their adventures with things like Mathematics and Languages.\n  \n\n\n    Equipment\n   \n\n\n   Even though Batman was a master of countless fighting styles, displayed an unfathomable understanding of advanced calculus, and was endowed with insightful wit and masterful cunning, from time to time the Caped Crusader had to rely on his arsenal of self-made tools of the trade to see the day through. What follows is a list of these handy gadgets.\n  \n\n\n\n     Batcostumes,\n    \n    sometimes referred to as\n    \n     Batsuits,\n    \n    are worn by Batman and Robin to disguise their identities. Commissioner Gordon also claimed that he wore the costume to \"strike fear into the hearts of criminals.\" At times, Batman has had his Bat-costume modified to protect him from various hazards or methods of attacks, including one Batcostume treated to be acid-proof and special thermal underwear, described below along with the\n    \n     Portable Freezing Chamber.\n    \n    Alfred Pennyworth constructs and maintains all these Batcostumes, except for those Barbara Gordon wears as Batgirl.\n   \n\n\n\n      Utility Belt\n     \n\n    is the yellow (Batman's or Batgirl's) or black (Robin's) belt of gadget pockets inside which Batman and Robin keep their weapons and devices. Unfortunately, Batman has been forced to use magnetic metals to construct both his and Robin's Utility Belts; thus, they are prone to immobilization by electromagnets, which also prevent the disengagements of their buckles.\n   \n\n\n\n    Handheld Gadgets\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Batarangs\n     \n\n    are the most commonly used weapon that Batman and Robin use whenever fighting against villains; these are essentially bat-shaped boomerangs. The Batarangs were often combined with the Batropes, either to act as grappling hooks or to tether enemies.\n   \n\n\n\n      Batropes\n     \n\n    are Batman's way of climbing high and steep walls, since he and Robin would rarely use elevators or stairs. Its hook is a Batarang, though a\n    grappling hook mortar\n    was sometimes used to scale especially tall buildings. The Dynamic Duo customarily use their Batarangs to secure a line and then execute \"Bat-Climbs\" up the side of the building. A Bat-Climb, unfortunately, makes for very slow going, more so than an elevator for instance, but it allows for secrecy. On occasion, Batman and Robin would use their Batropes to climb to a vantage point from which they could survey the surrounding area. Once their investigations had been completed, the Bat-Duo would use a \"Reverse Bat-Climb\" to get themselves back down to the ground. Batman is adamant about having both hands kept on the Batropes at virtually all times during all the Bat-Climbs, for obvious safety reasons.\n   \n\n\n     Bulletproof Bat-Shield\n    \n    is a defensive object Batman and Robin use to protect themselves against dangerous attacks. Sometimes they hold it themselves; other times, they have it attached to the Batmobile.\n   \n\n\n     Bat-Cuffs\n    \n    are, essentially, the same as ordinary police handcuffs, used to capture villains.\n   \n\n\n     Bat-Sleep Gas\n    \n    is a form of sleeping gas used on people, especially if Batman and Robin are taking them to or from the Batcave.\n   \n\n\n     Bat-Wake Gas\n    \n    is an antidote to Bat-Sleep Gas, as it wakes people up when they are at the Batcave.\n   \n\n\n     Universal Antidote Pills\n    \n    were small medical capsules capable of neutralizing all known forms of poisons and mind-altering chemicals.\n   \n\n\n     Bat-Directional Finder\n    \n    indicates which direction to take to find a certain substance.\n   \n\n\n     Bat-Air Press\n    \n    is for blowing up balloons.\n   \n\n\n     Bat-Capsule Dispensory\n    \n    is used as the storage cabinet for numerous crime-fighting pills of various types.\n   \n\n\n     Bat-Wax Solvent\n    \n    dissolves any type of wax.\n   \n\n\n     Sky-Writing Drone\n    \n    is a model jet that can write even the longest messages in the sky.\n   \n\n\n     Bat-Antidote Powder\n    \n    is used to recover from any form of poison.\n   \n\n\n     Bat-cillin,\n    \n    also called\n    \n     Bat-icillin,\n    \n    is presumably an antibiotic; it is available in lozenge form to prevent infection after either of the Bat-Duo sustains any open wounds. As is the case with any antibiotic, it is useless against viruses. Presumably developed by a pharmaceutical company that Bruce's primary business, \"Wayne Enterprises,\" controls, it is probably not an actual penicillin antibiotic.\n   \n\n\n     Mobile Phone Bat-Plugs\n    \n    enable the use of portable Batphones.\n   \n\n\n     Batzooka\n    \n    is a rocket launcher, useful against military tanks. It can also launch\n    \n     Batropes,\n    \n    described above, using its grappling hook mortar.\n   \n\n\n     Oceanic Repellent Bat-Sprays\n     ,\n    \n    four in number, are employed in case Batman has to fly the\n    \n     BatCopter\n    \n    (see below, under\n    \n     \"Vehicles\"\n    \n    ) over Gotham Harbor. The\n    \n     shark-repellent Bat-Spray\n    \n    once enabled him to drive off a shark.\n   \n\n\n     Bat-Springs.\n    \n\n\n\n     Portable Bat-Bombs\n    \n    are small explosive devices that Batman can plant seemingly at random in almost any location. These once enabled him and Robin to avoid the Minstrel cremating both of them alive.\n   \n\n\n     Instant unfolding Batcostumes with utility belts,\n    \n    which were used in exactly one third-season installment, were contained within two capsules that, when immersed in warm water, would expand to their full sizes. (In the Silver Age DC Comics about\n    \n     The Flash,\n    \n    Dr. Barry Allen customarily concealed the red uniform he wore as The Flash inside a golden ring he always wore in his civilian identity; its compression ratio was 1:100, and it expanded to its full size upon contact with air. This detail about The Flash's uniform might have given the show's writers the idea for what proved to be a once-and-done gimmick, since Adam West's and Burt Ward's clothes in that installment were not truly conducive to concealing full Batcostumes within them.)\n   \n\n\n\n    Batcave Equipment\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Batpoles\n    \n    are the way Bruce and Dick get from the stately family mansion, Wayne Manor, to the Batcave. (The technique they used in the DC Comics, descent of a flight of stairs, the access to which was concealed behind a grandfather clock, that led into the Batcave, was abandoned in the series as too time-consuming and too expensive.)\n   \n\n\n     Bat-Computer\n    \n    is the primary computer Batman uses for his crusade against crime. It is essentially a\n    \n     mainframe\n    \n    computer, and Batman and Robin alone are capable of operating it.

Designs have varied considerably over time, suggesting that Batman may have many Batcycles, as there are many Batmobiles. Though Batman and Robin had used ordinary motorcycles before,\n   \n    Batwoman\n   \n   was the first character to have a bat-styled motorcycle.\n  \n\n\n    Outside media adaptations\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Batman\n     \n     television series\n    \n\n\n\n   Built by Dan \"Magiera\" Dempski.\n  \n\n   Dempski used a donated Yamaha 250. \nThe bike was customized with a front steering assembly (the part with scallops on it), made of Filon, a fiberglass sheet with integrated nylon. The windshield was made out of plexiglass which had to be specially molded and custom blown. The sidecar was also a go-cart that would breakaway from the cycle it self.\n  \n\n   Later that year, a new Batcycle was introduced. It was produced by Kustomotive, conceived by Dan Dempski, designed by Tom Daniel, and built by Dan and Korky Korkes using a Yamaha Catalina 250. It was leased to\n   20th Century Fox\n   starting on April 18, 1966 for $50 a week with an additional $350 up front. The new Batcycle was first used in the 1966 film\n   \n    1966 movie\n   \n   and continued to appear in the rest of the TV series. Hubie Kerns and Victor Paul did most of the stunt work with the motorcycle throughout the series. The total amount paid to Kustomotive was $2,500. When the series was cancelled, Kustomotive used the Batcycle in\n   \n    car shows\n   \n   , paying royalties to Greenway, 20th Century Fox, and\n   \n    National Periodical Publications\n   \n   . Kustomotive built four replicas of the Batcycle for tours.\n  \n\n\n\n\n      Batman: The Animated Series\n     \n\n\n\n\n   The Batcycle is most often used by\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   and is sometimes used by Batman when the\n   \n    Batmobile\n   \n   is too cumbersome or is being repaired.\n  \n\n   The Batcycle was one of the many vehicles used by Batman and Robin in\n   \n\n     Batman: The Animated Series\n    \n\n   . The Batcycle was themed to look like Batman's other vehicles, the Batmobile,\n   \n    Batwing\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Batboat\n   \n   . Batman would use it in certain episodes, as would Robin. Perhaps the most important part the Batcycle played in the series was in the movie\n   \n\n     Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\n    \n\n   , where Batman jumped off the Batcycle so it would crash into a giant fan that was being controlled by\n   \n    the Joker\n   \n   . The Batcycle saw a little more use from Robin, particularly in the episodes \"\n   \n    Robin's Reckoning\n   \n   \".Robin would continue to use a variation of the Batcycle in later seasons after he had become\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n\n      Batman & Robin\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n    Batgirl\n   \n   drives a motorcycle called the\n   \n    Batblade\n   \n   when heading to the\n   \n    Gotham Observatory\n   \n   at the film's climax. This vehicle was covered in silver\n   \n    Ice Armor\n   \n   and could drive on slick ice covered streets.\n  \n\n\n\n\n      The Batman\n     \n\n\n\n\n   The Batcycle was used by Batman only a few times in\n   \n    The Batman\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The first time the Batcycle was glimpsed in the cartoon was when Catwoman stole Batman's utility belt and unwittingly pressed the button activating the Batcycle's autopilot in the Batcave. The second occasion was when a fight with the villain Gearhead destroyed the Batmobile and Batman had to design a new one. Batman finished constructing it but when Gearhead was on the loose again the Batmobile's power core was not properly charged. Thus, he needed another transportation and used the Batcycle but left it on autopilot while battling Gearhead.\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   eventually took it without Batman's permission to pursue the villain, but the Batcycle was destroyed after Gearhead infected it's computerized system with a nanotech virus. A variation of the Batcycle is also used in the series by\n   Robin\n   with his own colors on the bike. Robin has a similar Robin styled bike in the\n   \n    Teen Titans\n   \n   animated series.\n  \n\n\n\n\n      Batman: The Brave and the Bold\n     \n\n\n\n\n   The Batcycle Batman used in\n   \n    Batman: The Brave and the Bold\n   \n   animated series.\n  \n\n\n    Dark Knight Trilogy\n   \n\n\n\n    Toys\n   \n\n\n\n    Art Asylum\n   \n   created a toy version of the Batcycle for C3 Sets Wave 2 of Minimates in 2005.\n  \n\n\n    Video Games featuring The Batcycle\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      LEGO Batman: The Videogame\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Batman & Robin\n     \n\n\n\n\n     LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "response": "The latest movie in the Batman film franchise is \"The Batman,\" released in 2022. This film marks a reboot of the series, directed by Matt Reeves, and stars Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman. It shifts focus to a more mystery and detective-driven story, differing from earlier entries like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy (which ended in 2012) by emphasizing Batman's investigative skills over large-scale action. Key details include the involvement of villains such as Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, Paul Dano as the Riddler, and Colin Farrell as the Penguin, with plans for a related TV spinoff on HBO Max featuring Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon.

Timm and Radomski designed the series by closely emulating the Tim Burton films' \"otherworldly timelessness,\" incorporating period features such as black-and-white title cards, police blimps, 40s influenced fashion, 40s influenced car styling and a \"vintage\" color scheme in a largely film noir-influenced style. The series initially took as its theme a variation of music written by\n   \n    Danny Elfman\n   \n   for Burton's Batman film; later episodes of the series used a new theme with a similar style by Shirley Walker. The score of the series was influenced by Elfman and Walker's work on\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   and\n   \n\n     Batman Returns\n    \n\n   and the music of 40s film noir. The art style of the original animated series was also partially a reaction against the realism seen in shows like\n   \n    X-Men\n   \n   ; the second series in some ways was a further extension of that rejection of realism.\n  \n\n   Like\n   \n    X-Men\n   \n   , the program was much more adult oriented than previous typical superhero cartoon series. In their constant quest to make the show darker, the producers pushed the boundaries of action cartoons: it was the first such cartoon in years to depict firearms being fired instead of laser guns (only one person has ever been actually depicted as shot;\n   Commissioner Gordon\n   in episode 49 was seen to have a gunshot wound after the firefight was finished), Batman actually punching and kicking the antagonists, as well as the existence of blood (such as Batman having a trail of blood from his mouth); in addition, many of the series' backgrounds were painted on black paper. The distinctive visual combination of film noir imagery and Art Deco designs with a very dark color scheme was called \"Dark Deco\" by the producers. First-time producers Timm and Radomski reportedly encountered resistance from studio executives, but the success of Burton's first film allowed the embryonic series to survive long enough to produce a pilot episode, \"\n   On Leather Wings\n   \", which according to Timm \"got a lot of people off our backs.\"\n  \n\n\n    Acclaim\n   \n\n\n   The Emmy Award-winning series quickly received wide acclaim for its distinctive animation and mature writing, and it instantly became a hit. Fans of a wide age range praised the show's sophisticated, cinematic tone, character depth and psychological stories. Voice-actor\n   Kevin Conroy\n   used two distinct voices to portray Bruce Wayne and Batman, as\n   \n    Michael Keaton\n   \n   had done in the films. This series also featured a supporting cast that included major actors performing the voices of the various classic villains, most notably\n   Mark Hamill\n   , who defined a whole new career for himself in animation with his portrayal of\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   . The voice recording sessions were recorded with the actors together in a studio, like a radio play, unlike most animated films, in which the principal voice actors record separately and never meet (various interviews have noted that such an arrangement (having the cast record together) was a benefit to the show as a whole, as the actors were able to 'react' to one another, rather than simply 'reading the words').\n  \n\n   Key to the series' artistic success is that it managed to redefine classic characters, paying homage to their previous portrayals while giving them new dramatic force. The characterization of villains such as\n   \n    Two-Face\n   \n   and the\n   Mad Hatter\n   and heroes like\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   (who had not appeared in the Burton film series) demonstrate this.\n   The Penguin\n   is based upon his appearance in\n   \n    Batman Returns\n   \n   , which was being released at the same time as the series. The series also gave new life to nearly forgotten characters like the\n   Clock King\n   . An often noted example of dramatic change is\n   \n    Mr. Freeze\n   \n   ;\n   \n    Batman: TAS\n   \n   turned him from a clichéd mad scientist with a gimmick for cold, to a tragic figure whose frigid exterior hides a doomed love and a cold vindictive fury. Part of the tragedy is mimicked later in the plot of\n   \n    Joel Schumacher\n   \n   's live action movie\n   \n\n     Batman & Robin\n    \n\n   , although much of the drama was lost with the resurrection of the pun-quipping mad scientist image. Another example of dramatic change is\n   Clayface\n   , a character who to fans is believed to be far more intriguing to an audience due to his tragic past and almost 'sane' way of dealing with situations, and later influenced DC to recreate their version of the character to fit the animated universes. The most famous of the series' innovations is the Joker's hapless assistant,\n   Harley Quinn\n   , who became so popular that DC Comics later added her to the mainstream Batman comic continuity.\n  \n\n   This series became a cornerstone of the Warner Bros.' animation department, which became one of the top producers of television animation. For years, Warner Bros. Animation had been known only for doing Looney Tunes and their offshoots such as\n   \n    Tiny Toon Adventures\n   \n   . This was Warner's first attempt at doing a serious animated cartoon and it ended up working better than they thought. It also sparked a large franchise of similar TV adaptations of DC Comics characters. Despite the marketing decision by Warner Bros. of making the series a Saturday morning cartoon, Producer Bruce Timm and the crew were not interested in making a show aimed squarely at small children.\n  \n\n\n\n\n      The New Batman Adventures\n     \n\n\n\n\n   A completely new version of the series was launched to match the more efficient animation style of\n   \n    Superman: The Animated Series\n   \n   . It also opened up possibilities for crossovers. All characters, vehicles and props were redesigned, with the exception of\n   \n    Two-Face\n   \n   .\n   \n\n     The New Batman Adventures\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n\n     Batman Beyond\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Justice League\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Justice League Unlimited\n    \n\n   all form a continuity that fans refer to as the \"DC Animated Universe.\"\n  \n\n\n    Influence\n   \n\n\n\n    New characters\n   \n\n\n   New villains like\n   Red Claw\n   , the ninja\n   Kyodai Ken\n   , and the\n   Sewer King\n   were invented for the series, but to little acclaim. From the episode \"\n   Tyger, Tyger\n   \" another character named\n   Tygrus\n   was created, whose story was probably inspired by the H.G. Wells novel\n   \n    The Island of Dr. Moreau\n   \n   and William Blake's poem\n   \n    The Tyger\n   \n   .

    "question": "Who was Batman's first villian?",
    "response": "Batman's first villain was the unnamed mugger who murdered his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, when Bruce was a young child. This tragic event, as described in the context, occurred on their way home from seeing the film *The Mark of Zorro*, and it profoundly shaped Bruce's life, turning his personal loss into a lifelong mission to combat crime. This mugger represents the initial antagonist in Batman's storyline, symbolizing the random violence that Bruce vowed to eradicate.\n\nAs you explore Batman's early motivations, this incident highlights his transition from personal tragedy to a broader war on crime. Initially, Bruce targeted general underworld criminals and low-level thugs in Gotham City, driven by his desire to prevent others from suffering as he did. Over time, this evolved into confrontations with more themed villains, such as the Joker, who emerged as a significant adversary in his third year of crime-fighting. The Joker, indirectly created through Batman's actions, marked a shift toward battling elaborate, costumed criminals, reflecting Bruce's growth from fighting everyday crime to tackling symbolic representations of chaos and corruption.\n\nIf you'd like to delve deeper into how this early event influenced Batman's partnerships or strategies, I can expand on that based on the context.",

His personal favourite was the\n   Gray Ghost\n   , watching the television show with his father.\n  \n\n   On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to\n   \n    Wonder Woman\n   \n   , Bruce hadn't been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes' faithful friend and butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n  \n\n   Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from\n   \n    Yoru Sensei\n   \n   . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor's daughter\n   \n    Zatanna\n   \n   became very close.\n  \n\n   As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with\n   \n    Andrea Beaumont\n   \n   . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\".\n  \n\n\n    War on Crime\n   \n\n\n   Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city's underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   as his ward after witnessing his parents' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down\n   their murderer\n   . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and\n   Commissioner James Gordon\n   , working with them to control crime in Gotham.\n  \n\n   Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Poison Ivy\n   ,\n   \n    Mr. Freeze\n   \n   and\n   the Scarecrow\n   . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including\n   Catwoman\n   and\n   Two-Face\n   . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered\n   \n    the Joker\n   \n   , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created.\n  \n\n\n    New Adventures\n   \n\n\n   Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as\n   \n    Batwoman\n   \n   . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father's legacy as the next Police Commissioner.\n  \n\n   Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned\n   Tim Drake\n   from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder.\n  \n\n\n    Joining Up\n   \n\n\n   For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called\n   Blüdhaven\n   .\n  \n\n   Batman would later find himself in\n   Metropolis\n   , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with\n   \n    Lex Luthor\n   \n   , Batman would find himself working with\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker's plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue's gallery.\n  \n\n   He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another's home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity.\n  \n\n   Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper.\n  \n\n   It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world's greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League.\n  \n\n\n    Saving the World\n   \n\n\n   Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech's deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station's antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J'onn J'onzz' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna's destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch.\n  \n\n   Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman's mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don't even think about it\".\n  \n\n   When the Imperium's attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation.\n  \n\n   Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J'onn J'onzz. After freeing J'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J'onn J'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape.

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots.\n  \n\n\n    Powers and Abilities\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Master Acrobat:\n    \n    Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.\n   \n\n\n     Peak Human Conditioning:\n    \n    Through intense training, Batman represents the pinnacle of human physical potential.

Ed Boon, co-founder and creative director of NetherRealm Studios, stated that characters fall into two categories: \"power characters\" (characters relying on their brute strength and supernatural abilities), and \"gadget characters\" (characters relying on their weapons, objects, and other external mechanisms to win). Certain fighters have more than one fighting style, such as Nightwing's ability to switch between a staff and a pair of escrima sticks.\n  \n\n   The stages, based on locations such as the Batcave and Fortress of Solitude, feature multiple levels and various objects that the player can interact with. Each arena has its own unique elements, and characters exploit them differently depending on their class. For example, a gadget character like Batman can fire projectiles at a car to cause an explosion, while a power character like Superman can pick up the same car and smash his opponents with it; however, the players are given the option to disable interactive elements. According to Boon, stage selection is as important to the player as character selection.\n  \n\n   As players fight, their \"super meters\" build with energy that can be expended to perform enhanced special attacks or powerful super moves. The gauges are unique to each character and are utilized in different ways. For instance, Wonder Woman uses meter to switch between two fighting styles, while Solomon Grundy uses meter for an array of grapple moves. Players can also compete in wager battles, dubbed the Clash system, which combines individualized cutscene cinematics with the process of betting portions of super meter. In addition to the damage dealt from the battle, the winner steals power from their opponent's meter.\n  \n\n\n    Voice Actors\n   \n\n\n\n    Stephen Amell as Green Arrow (Arrow DLC skin)\n   \n\n    Troy Baker\n    as Sinestro, Nightwing (Dick Grayson), Atlantean Soldier\n   \n\n    Adam Baldwin as Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)\n   \n\n    Ed Boon as Scorpion (catchphrases only)\n   \n\n    Kimberly Brooks\n    as Batgirl\n   \n\n    Amy Carle as Announcer\n   \n\n    Lacey Chabert as Zatanna\n   \n\n    Kevin Conroy\n    as Batman\n   \n\n\n     Grey DeLisle\n    \n    as Catwoman, Green Lantern's Ring\n   \n\n    Debra Doetzer as Ladder Ending's Announcer\n   \n\n    Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, Radio Host 1\n   \n\n    Richard Epcar\n    as The Joker, Radio Host 2\n   \n\n\n     Jennifer Hale\n    \n    as Hawkgirl, Killer Frost\n   \n\n    J.G.

The game utilizes the Unreal Engine 3. Developer Ed Boon revealed plans to offer depth and promised a rich amount of single-player content and layered features for tournament players.Similar to Boon's previous DC-related title, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, there are restrictions on how violent the game can be, though Boon stated he is planning to push the T rating, replacing violence with \"crazy, over-the-top action.\"\n  \n\n   The campaign of the game is being written by NetherRealm Studios and DC Comics' writers as a stand-alone story. According to Lead Designer John Edwards, the story is meant to rationalize the game's fighting mechanics between characters that would not normally fight one another and explain how gadget characters like Batman can \"stand toe-to-toe\" with power characters like Superman.\n  \n\n   NetherRealm Studios reported that an automated system to push Injustice downloadable content to all users' consoles is under development. The game will connect to the Internet during use and download the information required for players who have bought DLC characters to play against others who have not. In addition, Ed Boon confirmed that downloadable content will not be included on-disc. Due to complaints about severe online lag in NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Mortal Kombat, the development team had made a \"new, more elaborate system\" and is optimizing the network code for an improved online experience.

Arthur started his criminal campaign by a daring but unsuccessful attempt to learn the secret identity of the\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   , in order to gain a fighting edge but his plan failed and he was defeated by Batman.\n  \n\n   Cluemaster made his grand reappearance in\n   \n    Detective Comics #647\n   \n   by\n   \n    Chuck Dixon\n   \n   and\n   Tom Lyle\n   . In this three issue story, Cluemaster has reformed and been released from\n   Blackgate\n   . Cured of his tendency to leave clues, Cluemaster originally joins a gang and plans their heists in exchange for 10% of their winnings. Later he kills the leader by suffocating him by putting a strong polymer over his mouth and nose, the bonds could only be broken by one substance which Cluemaster withheld from the gang leader. Cluemaster then begins to plan a master heist. During this time it is revealed\n   \n    Arthur Brown\n   \n   has a daughter named Stephanie, but rarely spends any time with her due to long periods of incarceration. When he returns to\n   \n    Gotham\n   \n   , \"rehabilitated,\" Stephanie becomes furious when she discovers that he has returned to crime without his need to leave clues behind. Making a costume for herself, she calls herself the\n   Spoiler\n   , finds out her father's plans, and leaves clues so that the police and Batman can stop him.\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   spots Spoiler on the rooftops during a police bust of Cluemaster's apartment and unmasks her, though she incapacitates Robin by hitting him in the face with a brick. Robin tracks her down and Batman, Robin and Spoiler set up plan in motion to take down Cluemaster, forbidding Spoiler from going to the bust because she was only motivated by revenge. Catching Cluemaster at his mall heist whilst he hauls a giant glass canister of money away by air, Stephanie is then held hostage by Cluemaster atop the canister, holding a vial of Acid to her face as Batman tries to stop him. Batman tells Cluemaster to stop and Cluemaster, thinking Batman will only lecture him about how it is morally wrong to disfigure a child, is taken aback when Batman simply reveals Spoiler is his daughter. Spoiler uses the shock of the revelation to gain the upper hand and attempts to use one of the chains attached to the Gunship lifting the canister to strangle Cluemaster, but Batman prevents this. Cluemaster is taken back to Blackgate.\n  \n\n   Each time the Cluemaster escapes or start some new plan, Stephanie dons her costume again in order to foil him. Eventually, she realizes she enjoys being a hero, and begins regular patrols as Spoiler. For a brief period of time she even replaces\n   \n    Tim Drake\n   \n   , as Robin, although her reckless and rebellious take on crimefighting has made her largely unfit for the role.\n  \n\n   With several other villains, Cluemaster becomes a member of the\n   \n    Injustice League\n   \n   , then later the\n   \n    Justice League Antarctica\n   \n   , attempting to reform. Cluemaster and his teammates volunteer to join the second\n   \n    Suicide Squad\n   \n   , a group sanctioned by the US government, in return for a full pardon of his crimes. The Cluemaster also hopes to make Stephanie proud of him.\n  \n\n\n    Seeming death\n   \n\n\n   During the mission, which involves dealing with terrorists and a lovesick genetic experiment, Cluemaster sees his friends,\n   \n    Big Sir\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Clock King\n   \n   and\n   \n    Multi-Man\n   \n   die. Only the first two are tragedies in his view, as Multi-Man has died many times before. In the resulting chaotic battle, Cluemaster seemingly saves\n   \n    Major Disaster\n   \n   's life twice, though the Major admits the situation was confusing. Cluemaster is seen shot many times through the chest. He survives this incident, with a year's recuperation in the hospital and many, many scars. He is encouraged by thoughts of his daughter.\n  \n\n   When he got out and discovers that his daughter has been killed, he takes on the secret identity Aaron Black and creates the \"Campaign for Culpability\", blaming Batman for his involvement in Stephanie's death, saying that she was not the first child working with Batman to die (which is indeed true), and that Batman should be brought to justice.\n  \n\n\n    The War of Jokes and Riddles\n   \n\n\n   In the Rebirth story the War of Jokes and Riddles, Cluemaster is one of the Gotham super-criminals who sides with the Joker during a citywide gang-war between Joker and Riddler.  Cluemaster is put on a team with\n   Kite-Man\n   ,\n   \n    Man-Bat\n   \n   , the\n   \n    Ventriloquist\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Tweedle Dee\n   \n   and\n   \n    Tweedle Dum\n   \n   . When Joker loses the advantage during the war, Cluemaster persuades his team into intentionally getting caught by Batman, explaining how if they stay with Joker the Riddler will kill them, if they try to run Joker would kill them and if they switch-sides that either of the villains could kill them.\n  \n\n\n    Batman Eternal\n   \n\n\n   In the New 52, during the events of Batman Eternal, Cluemaster teamed up with\n   \n    Owlman\n   \n   to create a scheme that would destroy Gotham City through having larger villains like Mad Hatter and Hush to distract and exhaust the Bat-Family while he and a team of lesser super criminals including\n   Lock-Up\n   ,\n   Ratcatcher\n   ,\n   \n    Firefly\n   \n   ,\n   Prankster\n   and\n   Signalman\n   performed the actual tasks to bring down Gotham.  By the end of the plan, Cluemaster having had worked Batman to exhaustion managed to set Gotham aflame, learned Bruce Wayne's secret-identity, and strapped a beaten Batman to the shattered Bat-Signal atop the GCPD building.  Cluemaster mocked the vigilante and nearly murdered him with a pistol to the head only to be shot himself by Owlman as part of the greater plan.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "question": "what year was batman release? ",
    "response": "It seems like you're asking about the release year of Batman. If you mean the original debut of the character, Batman was first introduced in Detective Comics #27, which was published in 1939 by DC Comics. This marked the beginning of Batman's long history in comics and pop culture.\n\nHowever, Batman has had many adaptations over the years, such as films like *Batman: Mask of the Phantasm* in 1993 or TV series like *Batman: The Animated Series* from 1992 to 1995. To give you the most precise answer, could you clarify if you're referring to a specific version, like the comics, a movie, or a TV show? That way, I can provide more details on the timeline you're interested in!",

His personal favourite was the\n   Gray Ghost\n   , watching the television show with his father.\n  \n\n   On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to\n   \n    Wonder Woman\n   \n   , Bruce hadn't been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes' faithful friend and butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n  \n\n   Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from\n   \n    Yoru Sensei\n   \n   . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor's daughter\n   \n    Zatanna\n   \n   became very close.\n  \n\n   As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with\n   \n    Andrea Beaumont\n   \n   . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\".\n  \n\n\n    War on Crime\n   \n\n\n   Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city's underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   as his ward after witnessing his parents' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down\n   their murderer\n   . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and\n   Commissioner James Gordon\n   , working with them to control crime in Gotham.\n  \n\n   Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Poison Ivy\n   ,\n   \n    Mr. Freeze\n   \n   and\n   the Scarecrow\n   . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including\n   Catwoman\n   and\n   Two-Face\n   . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered\n   \n    the Joker\n   \n   , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created.\n  \n\n\n    New Adventures\n   \n\n\n   Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as\n   \n    Batwoman\n   \n   . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father's legacy as the next Police Commissioner.\n  \n\n   Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned\n   Tim Drake\n   from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder.\n  \n\n\n    Joining Up\n   \n\n\n   For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called\n   Blüdhaven\n   .\n  \n\n   Batman would later find himself in\n   Metropolis\n   , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with\n   \n    Lex Luthor\n   \n   , Batman would find himself working with\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker's plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue's gallery.\n  \n\n   He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another's home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity.\n  \n\n   Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper.\n  \n\n   It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world's greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League.\n  \n\n\n    Saving the World\n   \n\n\n   Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech's deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station's antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J'onn J'onzz' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna's destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch.\n  \n\n   Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman's mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don't even think about it\".\n  \n\n   When the Imperium's attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation.\n  \n\n   Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J'onn J'onzz. After freeing J'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J'onn J'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape. The Batwing was pursued by Imperium craft and shot down, but rescued by John Stewart and Hawkgirl before the crippled Batwing could crash. Batman witnessed the other heroes battling the Imperium craft and the appearance of\n   \n    Wonder Woman\n   \n   .\n   \n    The Flash\n   \n   arrived at the end of the battle, having retrieved the Batwing's severed wing. After J'onzz informed the assembled heroes of the Imperium's invasion of\n   \n    Mars\n   \n   , their eventual defeat, and their inadvertent release by Earth astronauts, the Imperium's factories began manufacturing smoke to block out the sun's rays.\n  \n\n   The heroes spl",

    "question": "When did Batman first appear in a comic book?",
    "response": "Batman first appeared in a comic book in Detective Comics #27, which was published in May 1939. This issue, created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, introduced the character as a mysterious vigilante fighting crime in Gotham City, marking the beginning of his enduring legacy in the DC Universe.\n\nTo connect this to the context you've discussed, this original debut laid the groundwork for Batman's evolution across various adaptations. For instance, the \"All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder\" series (2005-2008) by Frank Miller and Jim Lee reimagines Batman's world in a self-contained continuity, building on the character's early traits from 1939. Similarly, Doug Moench's extensive Batman works in the 1980s and 1990s, such as those in Detective Comics and Batman titles, explore deeper character development that stems from these origins. Even \"Batman: The Animated Series\" (1992-1995) draws inspiration from Batman's foundational stories, adapting them into a modern animated format. Understanding this historical starting point can help you trace how Batman has been reinterpreted over the decades for educational or research purposes.",

Dick is frightened by Batman's violently ramming the police vehicles during the chase. When Dick begins to cry, Batman smacks him, though he then catches himself, questioning these actions. He tells Dick he will find his parents' killer, and tells him not to trust the Gotham police.\n  \n\n   Arriving in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , Batman drops Dick off, leaving him to his own devices.  When Dick asks what he can eat Batman coldly tells Dick to eat the cave's vermin if he is hungry. Alfred informs Batman that Vicki is in critical condition, but knows a doctor in Paris who might be able to save her. Alfred contacts\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , who is enraged to learn of Batman's kidnapping of Dick. Alfred reveals that Batman knows Superman's secret identity, thus blackmailing Superman into bringing the doctor from Paris to Gotham. Batman and Alfred get into a heated argument over Alfred's providing Dick with clean clothes, a blanket and food, and when Batman manhandles Dick, Alfred orders him to cease, invoking a bitter reaction from Batman.\n  \n\n   The\n   \n    Justice League\n   \n   , consisting of Superman, Wonder Woman, Plastic Man and Green Lantern, discusses Batman. Green Lantern and Plastic Man suggest talking to or inviting him into the League. Superman wants to arrest him and Wonder Woman wants to kill him. The latter two heroes argue rather heatedly over the issue, but are implied to have romantic feelings for each other and possibly even a relationship. The argument ends in a kiss, and Wonder Woman leaves in a huff, agreeing to wait before acting on her own to stop Batman. Batman comes to the aid of\n   \n    Black Canary\n   \n   , who is fighting a group of thugs, including \"Jocko-Boy\" Vanzetti, who killed Dick's parents. After defeating the criminals, the two crimefighters share a romantic interlude, before Batman takes Canary home, with Vanzetti bound and gagged in the Batmobile's trunk. Batman and Dick manage to extract from Jocko-Boy the name of the person who hired him:\n   \n    the Joker\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Dick wants to fight crime with Batman, but Batman says he needs a secret identity first. Batman leaves the cave when he sees Green Lantern's symbol in the sky. After dumping Jocko-Boy in a river, Batman meets Green Lantern, but refuses to speak to  him. Dick creates a costume, basing it on Robin Hood. Joker goes to see\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   to tell her he has an idea in mind for Batman. Batman returns to the cave, and when Dick tells him his name is Hood, Batman points out that an opponent can easily pull the hood down over his head. Batman tells him to lose the hood and names him Robin. Dick receives a new costume made by Alfred.\n  \n\n   Together they confront the Green Lantern. Robin paints the entire room yellow and he covers himself and Batman in yellow. Green Lantern's powers have no effect on something coloured yellow. Lantern tries to persuade Batman that his methods are not acceptable, either to the super-hero community or the world at large. Batman mocks his arguments and Lantern is further incensed when both he and Robin deny that Robin is Dick Grayson. Lantern is about to leave when Robin steals his ring causing a fight between them.  Robin strikes Lantern with a move that almost kills him before Batman saves his life. Batman then takes Robin to his parents' graves, where they share a moment of mutual grief. The heroes then go underground at the request of Catwoman who is severely injured.\n  \n\n   Jim Gordon is shown trying to solve a crime when he learns his wife has been in an accident. At the same time his daughter dressed as\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   is fighting crime. Black Canary robs a group of snuff film makers and proceeds to set them on fire. Batgirl is later arrested and Jim is shown to be deeply depressed when he calls his former lover\n   Sarah\n   at the request of his daughter.\n  \n\n   The first issue launched with four different covers.  three of them were illustrated by Jim Lee—one sporting Batman, the other Robin and one a sketch variant of Batman. Frank Miller illustrated the fourth. Since then, Frank Miller has drawn variant covers for the series. With the exception of  issue #2, the Miller covers are sold in 1:10 ratios. For issue #8 and #9, the variant covers were being drawn by Neal Adams. The cover for #10 was drawn by Frank Quitely.\n  \n\n\n    Continuity\n   \n\n\n   The\n   \n    All Star\n   \n   titles are self-contained story arcs existing outside of official DC Comics continuity. Despite sharing a label with Grant Morrison's\n   \n    All Star Superman\n   \n   ,\n   \n    All Star Batman and Robin\n   \n   exists in its own continuity unrelated to other books in the All Star imprint.\n  \n\n   Frank Miller has also stated that\n   \n    All Star Batman and Robin\n   \n   does exist in the same continuity as the other storylines in his \"\n   \n\n     Dark Knight Universe\n    \n\n   \". This consists of Miller's\n   \n\n     Dark Knight\n    \n\n   , its sequel\n   \n    The Dark Knight Strikes Again\n   \n   ,\n   \n\n     Batman: Year One\n    \n\n   , and the\n   Todd McFarlane\n   collaboration\n   \n    Spawn/Batman\n   \n   . Of these, only\n   \n    Year One\n   \n   is considered canonical to the mainstream DC Universe. In 2007, Frank Miller's \"Dark Knight Universe\" was officially designated as Earth-31 within the new DC Comics Multiverse composed of 52 alternate universes. Although set in the same continuity, there is a possible inconsistency with the timeline, as\n   \n    All Star Batman and Robin\n   \n   has a younger Batman in the early-21st century, while\n   \n    The Dark Knight\n   \n   (published in 1986) tells the story of a 50 year old Batman during what appears to be a Cold War-like tension between the US and Russia. But the story takes places in a dystopic future, and no year is ever specified. In reality Ronald Reagan lived until 2004, well after the Cold War \"officially\" ended, the David Letterman show was still on the air until recently and Russia is still nuclear equipped as of this writing.\n  \n\n   Morrison has admitted to being uncertain whether their Superman and the version featured in\n   \n    All Star Batman and Robin\n   \n   are the same due to the dramatic time differences between the two books: \"I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, I guess I do see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman at the beginning of his career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond\n   \n    All Star Batman\n   \n   . But it could be the same character as far as I am concerned. That’s where they may have ended up.\"\n  \n\n\n    Reception\n   \n\n\n\n    Sales\n   \n\n\n   The series' first issue sold over 300,000 copies.\n   The once-monthly series became increasingly delayed over time, to the point where only one issue was published in 2006. When issue #5 was released, the series was placed on a regular bi-monthly schedule, with the exception of Issue #10, which was postponed from April 9 release to August 27 release, and then to a September 10 release, which it successfully met, only for the book to be recalled due to a printing error that left numerous profanities insufficiently censored.\n  \n\n   Despite drops in sales since the first issue,\n   \n    All Star Batman and Robin\n   \n   issues regularly topped DC Comics' highest-selling chart on the months when they came out.\n  \n\n\n    Criticism\n   \n\n\n   Initially released with great fanfare and to much anticipation,\n   \n    All Star Batman\n   \n   has consistently received derision from critics. Nearly all complaints about the series are directed at Frank Miller's writing, specifically his non-traditional interpretat \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Doug Moench\n    \n\n\n      General Information\n     \n\n\n       Birth Date:\n      \n\n       February 23, 1948\n      \n\n\n\n       Birth Place:\n      \n\n       Chicago, Illinois USA\n      \n\n\n\n\n    Doug Moench\n   \n   is an American writer.

The original episodes, produced by Bruce Timm and\n   Eric Radomski\n   , were first aired on the Fox Network from 1992 to 1995. When the first season of the series aired on weekday afternoons, it lacked an on-screen title in the opening credits and was known only as\n   \n\n     Batman\n    \n\n   (and would be referred to as such in episode recaps that summarized what had happened \"previously on\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   ...\") When its timeslot was moved to weekends for the second series, it was named\n   \n\n     The Adventures of Batman & Robin\n    \n\n   , a title originally used in the 1969-1970 animated series created by Filmation, to emphasize the crime fighting partnership of the characters and allow younger audiences to become more familiar with\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   , who would shortly afterwards feature in the 1995 film\n   \n\n     Batman Forever\n    \n\n   .\n  \n\n   The series was the first of what fans refer to as the DC Animated Universe (DCAU), a shared continuity of Batman shows throughout the 1990s culminating in a Justice League cartoon in the early 2000s.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Overview\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Creation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Acclaim\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n\n          The New Batman Adventures\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Influence\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.1\n        \n\n         New characters\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.2\n        \n\n         Bruce Wayne\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Bat Equipment\n      \n\n\n\n\n      4\n     \n\n      Episodes\n     \n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n         Lost episode\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Theatrical and direct-to-video releases\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Cast\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.1\n        \n\n         Main Protagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.2\n        \n\n         Supporting protagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.3\n        \n\n         Main antagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.4\n        \n\n         Supporting antagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Videos\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Overview\n   \n\n\n\n    Creation\n   \n\n\n   The original series was partially inspired by\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 blockbuster\n   \n\n     Batman\n    \n\n   film and the acclaimed Superman cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios in the 1940s. Timm and Radomski designed the series by closely emulating the Tim Burton films' \"otherworldly timelessness,\" incorporating period features such as black-and-white title cards, police blimps, 40s influenced fashion, 40s influenced car styling and a \"vintage\" color scheme in a largely film noir-influenced style. The series initially took as its theme a variation of music written by\n   \n    Danny Elfman\n   \n   for Burton's Batman film; later episodes of the series used a new theme with a similar style by Shirley Walker. The score of the series was influenced by Elfman and Walker's work on\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   and\n   \n\n     Batman Returns\n    \n\n   and the music of 40s film noir. The art style of the original animated series was also partially a reaction against the realism seen in shows like\n   \n    X-Men\n   \n   ; the second series in some ways was a further extension of that rejection of realism.\n  \n\n   Like\n   \n    X-Men\n   \n   , the program was much more adult oriented than previous typical superhero cartoon series. In their constant quest to make the show darker, the producers pushed the boundaries of action cartoons: it was the first such cartoon in years to depict firearms being fired instead of laser guns (only one person has ever been actually depicted as shot;\n   Commissioner Gordon\n   in episode 49 was seen to have a gunshot wound after the firefight was finished), Batman actually punching and kicking the antagonists, as well as the existence of blood (such as Batman having a trail of blood from his mouth); in addition, many of the series' backgrounds were painted on black paper. The distinctive visual combination of film noir imagery and Art Deco designs with a very dark color scheme was called \"Dark Deco\" by the producers. First-time producers Timm and Radomski reportedly encountered resistance from studio executives, but the success of Burton's first film allowed the embryonic series to survive long enough to produce a pilot episode, \"\n   On Leather Wings\n   \", which according to Timm \"got a lot of people off our backs.\"\n  \n\n\n    Acclaim\n   \n\n\n   The Emmy Award-winning series quickly received wide acclaim for its distinctive animation and mature writing, and it instantly became a hit. Fans of a wide age range praised the show's sophisticated, cinematic tone, character depth and psychological stories. Voice-actor\n   Kevin Conroy\n   used two distinct voices to portray Bruce Wayne and Batman, as\n   \n    Michael Keaton\n   \n   had done in the films. This series also featured a supporting cast that included major actors performing the voices of the various classic villains, most notably\n   Mark Hamill\n   , who defined a whole new career for himself in animation with his portrayal of\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   . The voice recording sessions were recorded with the actors together in a studio, like a radio play, unlike most animated films, in which the principal voice actors record separately and never meet (various interviews have noted that such an arrangement (having the cast record together) was a benefit to the show as a whole, as the actors were able to 'react' to one another, rather than simply 'reading the words').\n  \n\n   Key to the series' artistic success is that it managed to redefine classic characters, paying homage to their previous portrayals while giving them new dramatic force. The characterization of villains such as\n   \n    Two-Face\n   \n   and the\n   Mad Hatter\n   and heroes like\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   (who had not appeared in the Burton film series) demonstrate this.\n   The Penguin\n   is based upon his appearance in\n   \n    Batman Returns\n   \n   , which was being released at the same time as the series. The series also gave new life to nearly forgotten characters like the\n   Clock King\n   . An often noted example of dramatic change is\n   \n    Mr. Freeze\n   \n   ;\n   \n    Batman: TAS\n   \n   turned him from a clichéd mad scientist with a gimmick for cold, to a tragic figure whose frigid exterior hides a doomed love and a cold vindictive fury. Part of the tragedy is mimicked later in the plot of\n   \n    Joel Schumacher\n   \n   's live action movie\n   \n\n     Batman & Robin\n    \n\n   , although much of the drama was lost with the resurrection of the pun-quipping mad scientist image. Another example of dramatic change is\n   Clayface\n   , a character who to fans is believed to be far more intriguing to an audience due to his tragic past and almost 'sane' way of dealing with situations, and later influenced DC to recreate their version of the character to fit the animated universes. The most famous of the series' innovations is the Joker's hapless assistant,\n   Harley Quinn\n   , who became so popular that DC Comics later added her to the mainstream Batman comic continuity.\n  \n\n   This series became a cornerstone of the Warner Bros.' animation department, which became one of the top producers of television animation. For years, Warner Bros. Animation had been known only for doing Looney Tunes and their offshoots such as\n   \n    Tiny Toon Adventures\n   \n   . This was Warner's first attempt at doing a serious animated cartoon and it ended up working better than they thought. It also sparked a large franchise of similar TV adaptations of DC Comics characters. Despite the marketing decision by Warner Bros. of making the series a Saturday morning cartoon, Producer Bruce Timm and the crew were not interested in making a show aimed squarely at small children.\n  \n\n\n\n\n      The New Batman Adventures\n     \n\n\n\n\n   A completely new version of the series was launched to match the more efficient animation style of\n   \n    Superman: The Animated Series\n   \n   . It also opened up possibilities for crossovers.

These series are helmed by renowned writers and artists in the American comic book industry and attempt to retell some of the history of prominent DC Universe characters, but outside of DC Universe continuity, and not be restricted by it, in order to appeal to new and returning readers.

When Grayson's parents are shot to death by a hit man, he is escorted from the scene by several cops of the\n   Gotham City Police Department\n   in a threatening manner. Vicki and\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   chase after them. Batman begins searching for the killer and then rescues Dick Grayson from the police, telling him that he has been drafted into a war. More police chase after the\n   \n    Batmobile\n   \n   with orders to kill Batman, during which Vicki is seriously injured. Dick is frightened by Batman's violently ramming the police vehicles during the chase. When Dick begins to cry, Batman smacks him, though he then catches himself, questioning these actions. He tells Dick he will find his parents' killer, and tells him not to trust the Gotham police.\n  \n\n   Arriving in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , Batman drops Dick off, leaving him to his own devices.  When Dick asks what he can eat Batman coldly tells Dick to eat the cave's vermin if he is hungry. Alfred informs Batman that Vicki is in critical condition, but knows a doctor in Paris who might be able to save her. Alfred contacts\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , who is enraged to learn of Batman's kidnapping of Dick. Alfred reveals that Batman knows Superman's secret identity, thus blackmailing Superman into bringing the doctor from Paris to Gotham. Batman and Alfred get into a heated argument over Alfred's providing Dick with clean clothes, a blanket and food, and when Batman manhandles Dick, Alfred orders him to cease, invoking a bitter reaction from Batman.\n  \n\n   The\n   \n    Justice League\n   \n   , consisting of Superman, Wonder Woman, Plastic Man and Green Lantern, discusses Batman. Green Lantern and Plastic Man suggest talking to or inviting him into the League. Superman wants to arrest him and Wonder Woman wants to kill him. The latter two heroes argue rather heatedly over the issue, but are implied to have romantic feelings for each other and possibly even a relationship. The argument ends in a kiss, and Wonder Woman leaves in a huff, agreeing to wait before acting on her own to stop Batman. Batman comes to the aid of\n   \n    Black Canary\n   \n   , who is fighting a group of thugs, including \"Jocko-Boy\" Vanzetti, who killed Dick's parents. After defeating the criminals, the two crimefighters share a romantic interlude, before Batman takes Canary home, with Vanzetti bound and gagged in the Batmobile's trunk. Batman and Dick manage to extract from Jocko-Boy the name of the person who hired him:\n   \n    the Joker\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Dick wants to fight crime with Batman, but Batman says he needs a secret identity first. Batman leaves the cave when he sees Green Lantern's symbol in the sky. After dumping Jocko-Boy in a river, Batman meets Green Lantern, but refuses to speak to  him. Dick creates a costume, basing it on Robin Hood. Joker goes to see\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   to tell her he has an idea in mind for Batman. Batman returns to the cave, and when Dick tells him his name is Hood, Batman points out that an opponent can easily pull the hood down over his head. Batman tells him to lose the hood and names him Robin. Dick receives a new costume made by Alfred.\n  \n\n   Together they confront the Green Lantern. Robin paints the entire room yellow and he covers himself and Batman in yellow. Green Lantern's powers have no effect on something coloured yellow. Lantern tries to persuade Batman that his methods are not acceptable, either to the super-hero community or the world at large. Batman mocks his arguments and Lantern is further incensed when both he and Robin deny that Robin is Dick Grayson. Lantern is about to leave when Robin steals his ring causing a fight between them.  Robin strikes Lantern with a move that almost kills him before Batman saves his life. Batman then takes Robin to his parents' graves, where they share a moment of mutual grief. The heroes then go underground at the request of Catwoman who is severely injured.\n  \n\n   Jim Gordon is shown trying to solve a crime when he learns his wife has been in an accident. At the same time his daughter dressed as\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   is fighting crime. Black Canary robs a group of snuff film makers and proceeds to set them on fire. Batgirl is later arrested and Jim is shown to be deeply depressed when he calls his former lover\n   Sarah\n   at the request of his daughter.\n  \n\n   The first issue launched with four different covers.  three of them were illustrated by Jim Lee—one sporting Batman, the other Robin and one a sketch variant of Batman. Frank Miller illustrated the fourth. Since then, Frank Miller has drawn variant covers for the series. With the exception of  issue #2, the Miller covers are sold in 1:10 ratios. For issue #8 and #9, the variant covers were being drawn by Neal Adams. The cover for #10 was drawn by Frank Quitely.\n  \n\n\n    Continuity\n   \n\n\n   The\n   \n    All Star\n   \n   titles are self-contained story arcs existing outside of official DC Comics continuity. Despite sharing a label with Grant Morrison's\n   \n    All Star Superman\n   \n   ,\n   \n    All Star Batman and Robin\n   \n   exists in its own continuity unrelated to other books in the All Star imprint.\n  \n\n   Frank Miller has also stated that\n   \n    All Star Batman and Robin\n   \n   does exist in the same continuity as the other storylines in his \"\n   \n\n     Dark Knight Universe\n    \n\n   \". This consists of Miller's\n   \n\n     Dark Knight\n    \n\n   , its sequel\n   \n    The Dark Knight Strikes Again\n   \n   ,\n   \n\n     Batman: Year One\n    \n\n   , and the\n   Todd McFarlane\n   collaboration\n   \n    Spawn/Batman\n   \n   . Of these, only\n   \n    Year One\n   \n   is considered canonical to the mainstream DC Universe. In 2007, Frank Miller's \"Dark Knight Universe\" was officially designated as Earth-31 within the new DC Comics Multiverse composed of 52 alternate universes. Although set in the same continuity, there is a possible inconsistency with the timeline, as\n   \n    All Star Batman and Robin\n   \n   has a younger Batman in the early-21st century, while\n   \n    The Dark Knight\n   \n   (published in 1986) tells the story of a 50 year old Batman during what appears to be a Cold War-like tension between the US and Russia. But the story takes places in a dystopic future, and no year is ever specified. In reality Ronald Reagan lived until 2004, well after the Cold War \"officially\" ended, the David Letterman show was still on the air until recently and Russia is still nuclear equipped as of this writing.\n  \n\n   Morrison has admitted to being uncertain whether their Superman and the version featured in\n   \n    All Star Batman and Robin\n   \n   are the same due to the dramatic time differences between the two books: \"I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, I guess I do see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman at the beginning of his career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond\n   \n    All Star Batman\n   \n   . But it could be the same character as far as I am concerned. That’s where they may have ended up.\"\n  \n\n\n    Reception\n   \n\n\n\n    Sales\n   \n\n\n   The series' first issue sold over 300,000 copies.\n   The once-monthly series became increasingly delayed over time, to the point where only one issue was published in 2006. When issue #5 was released, the series was placed on a regular bi-monthly schedule, with the exception of Issue #10, which was postponed from April 9 release to August 27 release, and then to a September 10 release, which it successfully met, only for the book to be recalled due to a printing error that left numerous profanities insufficiently censored.\n  \n\n   Despite drops in sales since the first issue,\n   \n    All Star Batman and Robin\n   \n   issues regularly topped DC Comics' highest-selling chart on the months when they came out.\n  \n\n\n    Criticism\n   \n\n\n   Initially released with great fanfare and to much anticipation,\n   \n    All Star Batman\n   \n   has consistently received derision from critics. Nearly all complaints about the series are directed at Frank Miller's writing, specifically his non-traditional interpretat \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Batman\n    \n\n\n      General Information\n     \n\n\n       Real name:\n      \n\n       Bruce Wayne\n      \n\n\n\n       Aliases:\n      \n\n\n        Batman\n       \n       The Batman\n       The Dark Knight\n       The World's Greatest Detective\n       The Caped Crusader\n      \n\n\n\n       Portrayed by:\n      \n\n       Kevin Conroy\n       (voice)\n      \n\n\n\n       Appearances:\n      \n\n\n        Batman: The Animated Series\n       \n\n        Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\n       \n\n        Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero\n       \n\n        The Batman/Superman Movie\n       \n\n        Batman Beyond\n       \n\n        Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker\n       \n\n        Static Shock\n       \n\n        Justice League\n       \n\n        Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman\n       \n\n\n         Justice League Unlimited\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Batman\n   \n   is a costumed crimefighter who is actually billionaire\n   \n    Bruce Wayne\n   \n   by day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       History\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Early life\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         War on Crime\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         New Adventures\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Joining Up\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Saving the World\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Joker's Final Joke\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.7\n        \n\n         Late Adventures\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.8\n        \n\n         Passing the Mantle of the Bat\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.9\n        \n\n         The Savage Timeline\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Powers and Abilities\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Equipment\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Vehicles\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Appearances\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Links\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    History\n   \n\n\n\n    Early life\n   \n\n\n   As a young child, Bruce Wayne would idolize masked heroes who fought crime and corruption, including Zorro. His personal favourite was the\n   Gray Ghost\n   , watching the television show with his father.\n  \n\n   On the way home from seeing the film, The Mark of Zorro, Bruce Wayne watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger. Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. As he later claimed to\n   \n    Wonder Woman\n   \n   , Bruce hadn't been a \"kid\" since he was eight years old. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes' faithful friend and butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n  \n\n   Bruce learned many arts and sciences toward the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara and martial arts from\n   \n    Yoru Sensei\n   \n   . While he trained with Zatara, he and his mentor's daughter\n   \n    Zatanna\n   \n   became very close.\n  \n\n   As he began operating as a vigilante, Bruce met and fell in love with\n   \n    Andrea Beaumont\n   \n   . Their relationship helped mend his pain, to the point where he was willing to give up becoming a vigilante to be with her. However, Andrea walked out of his life under mysterious circumstances, leaving him to become more determined to fight crime. Shortly afterwards, he chose to take up the symbol of the Bat, a creature of the night. Using it, he would strike fear into those who preyed on the innocent as \"the Batman\".\n  \n\n\n    War on Crime\n   \n\n\n   Using the caverns he discovered below Wayne Manor, Bruce built his secret headquarters, the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   . He gradually fought the underworld, targeting both low-level criminals and major players in the city's underworld. Bruce Wayne also took in\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   as his ward after witnessing his parents' murder. Batman eventually took Dick as his partner Robin, after catching him attempting to track down\n   their murderer\n   . He also gradually built a partnership with the Gotham City Police Department and\n   Commissioner James Gordon\n   , working with them to control crime in Gotham.\n  \n\n   Over the years, new criminals began operating in Gotham, with many choosing costumes and themes for their crimes. These included\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Poison Ivy\n   ,\n   \n    Mr. Freeze\n   \n   and\n   the Scarecrow\n   . Some of these criminals were also tied directly to his personal life, including\n   Catwoman\n   and\n   Two-Face\n   . Of the many \"supervillains\" he fought, Batman most frequently encountered\n   \n    the Joker\n   \n   , a clown themed criminal who he indirectly created.\n  \n\n\n    New Adventures\n   \n\n\n   Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as\n   \n    Batwoman\n   \n   . During his final years working with Dick, a new vigilante called\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   began operating with them. Batman eventually deduced her identity to be Barbara Gordon and inducted her into their operations. She would become his most frequent ally and later follow her father's legacy as the next Police Commissioner.\n  \n\n   Around that time, Bruce and Dick fell out of favour after he brutally interrogated a criminal in front of a family. After he recruited Barbara without his consultation, Grayson finally had enough and left the role of Robin. Some time after this, Batman rescued an orphaned\n   Tim Drake\n   from Two-Face. To protect the boy from the criminal, he brought him into his care. Inspired by Batman and combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim stole the Robin costume from the Batcave and helped him stop the criminal. Deciding to let him join his war, Batman trained him to become the next Boy Wonder.\n  \n\n\n    Joining Up\n   \n\n\n   For a short amount of time, Dick Grayson returned to Gotham as Nightwing to assist his former mentor. While he was a welcome addition, the two of them never truly seemed to forget the argument that caused Dick Grayson to leave. Despite this, the partnership remained stable. Nightwing would spend a decent amount of time in Gotham, but he would later leave to establish himself in another city called\n   Blüdhaven\n   .\n  \n\n   Batman would later find himself in\n   Metropolis\n   , having followed the Joker to the city. While his long-time nemesis struck a deal with\n   \n    Lex Luthor\n   \n   , Batman would find himself working with\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   to thwart the plot. After foiling the Joker's plans to kill the Man of Steel and destroy Metropolis, he would return to the city a couple of times to stop villains from his own rogue's gallery.\n  \n\n   He would also form an unlikely partnership with the young Static when another case brought the heroes into one another's home city. While these two partnerships did not usually start off well, Batman would eventually learn to respect their abilities and would trust both of them with his secret identity.\n  \n\n   Batman had also worked with other superheroes such as the demon, Etrigan, and the Creeper.\n  \n\n   It is later revealed that he was acquainted with many more of the world's greatest heroes. This group of heroes would later come together to foil an alien plot to take over the Earth. Forming a new partnership, they became the founding members of the Justice League.\n  \n\n\n    Saving the World\n   \n\n\n   Over the course of a few months, Batman had detected several security breaches in Wayne Tech's deep space monitoring network. While investigating the Wayne Tech Metropolis sub station, he encountered three scientists speaking a strange language. These scientists tampered with the station's antenna, and when confronted, displayed superhuman strength and resilience. Though Superman arrived to assist, he was incapacitated by J'onn J'onzz' telepathic contact. Batman was unable to prevent the scientists from destroying the antenna. After the antenna's destruction, Superman gave Batman a signal watch to call him for help if he needed it. Batman tracked the scientists to an abandoned S.T.A.R. Labs facility where he found the scientists being held in stasis pods. He was attacked by a shape shifting sentry and rendered unconscious, but not before signaling Superman with the watch.\n  \n\n   Superman found the unconscious Batman at the S.T.A.R. Labs facility, just as a meteor crashed to Earth in Metropolis park. Superman left Batman with an ambulance crew and flew off to investigate the meteor. Just as the medic was about to look under Batman's mask, he reached up and grabbed her hand saying \"don't even think about it\".\n  \n\n   When the Imperium's attack walker emerged from the meteor, incapacitated Superman and began raining destruction down on Metropolis, Batman took off in the Batwing which he seemed to have summoned while lying on the gurney. Batman began firing missiles on the walker and then two more walkers emerged from the meteor. When military air and armor units arrived on the scene, Batman followed Superman who had mysteriously left the battle without explanation.\n  \n\n   Batman tracked Superman to a military base in the mountains outside Metropolis where they found more humans in stasis pods and the imprisoned J'onn J'onzz. After freeing J'onzz and learning of the Imperium, the trio were stopped by Imperium forces posing as military personnel. Outnumbered, Batman fled with the incapacitated J'onn J'onzz in the Batwing while Superman covered their escape.

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots.\n  \n\n\n    Powers and Abilities\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Master Acrobat:\n    \n    Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.\n   \n\n\n     Peak Human Conditioning:\n    \n    Through intense training, Batman represents the pinnacle of human physical potential.

    "question": "Hi! Is Batman a real human? ",
    "response": "No, Batman is not a real human; he's a fictional character created for comic books and stories. In the comics and movies, Batman is the alter ego of Bruce Wayne, a made-up billionaire who fights crime, but this is all part of a creative universe invented by people like Bob Kane and Bill Finger. This helps us think about how stories in books, TV, and films aren't real life, but they can inspire us to learn more about heroes and history. If you're curious, would you like to hear about how Batman was first created or some fun facts about his adventures?",

As the Waynes' only son, Bruce was the sole heir to the family fortune as well as his father's business Wayne Industries. When Bruce was a young boy, his parents were brutally gunned down by a mugger, leaving Bruce an orphan. The family butler,\n   Alfred Pennyworth\n   , picked Bruce up at the police station and soon became his legal guardian. Alfred raised Bruce in Wayne Manor as if he were his own son. Upon visiting his parents' graveside, Bruce made a solemn vow that he would devote himself to combating crime in Gotham City.\n  \n\n   As a teenager, Bruce developed a friendship with a fellow student named\n   Ethan Bennett\n   . The two enjoyed a friendly rivalry with one another, one that often demonstrated itself on the basketball court. As they grew older, Wayne devoted more of his time towards the management of Wayne Industries, and Ethan went on to become a detective for the Gotham City Police Department, but they kept in contact with one another, and Bruce would occasionally invite him over to the estate for a game of \"one-on-one\".\n  \n\n   As time progressed, Bruce found the means by which he could keep the promise he made at his parents' graves. He fashioned a dark costume for himself to conceal his true identity and took on the guise of the Batman. With the reluctant help of his butler Alfred, Bruce established a crime-fighting command center in a cave beneath Wayne Manor. This soon became known as the Batcave. His connection to Wayne Industries provided him access to technology that he used to develop his crime-fighting arsenal. He installed an advanced computer network in the Batcave, dubbed the Bat-Wave, and he also designed weaponry, which he incorporated into a utility belt. In addition, he also developed an array of vehicles such as the Batmobile, the Bat-Glider and the Batplane, as well as a manned set of robotic armor which he called the Bat-Bot.\n  \n\n   For the first two years of his career, Bruce mostly fought common street-level thugs and members of organized crime. Reports of the Batman's activities quickly circulated throughout the city. Chief of police\n   Angel Rojas\n   took a rigid stance against acts of vigilantism and entrusted his detectives, including Ethan Bennett, to do everything in their power to bring the Batman to justice. Ethan and his new partner, a detective from Metropolis named\n   Ellen Yin\n   , committed many man-hours investigating the Batman. Secretly though, Ethan actually advocated the Batman’s ability to clean up the streets of Gotham.\n  \n\n   In his third year of crime-fighting, Bruce encountered an individual who proved to be his most bizarre and dangerous adversary to date –\n   the Joker\n   . He first met the Joker after the latter escaped from his hospital room at Arkham Asylum. He prevented the Joker from releasing a deadly nerve gas over the city, after which, he promptly returned him to Arkham Asylum. The Joker, never one to stay in captivity for long, returned time and time again to plague the Batman with outrageous new schemes.\n  \n\n   The emergence of the Joker appeared to have inspired many members of Gotham's underworld to likewise take up costumed identities, many of whom adopted various trademarks or gimmicks that set them apart from the common criminal. Batman’s first super-powered adversary was a Brazilian mercenary named\n   Bane\n   . Gang leaders brought Bane into the United States in the hopes of destroying the Batman through superior muscle power, but fortunately for Bruce, the Bat-Bot armor proved an adequate foil against the oversized behemoth. More and more colorful villains popped up in Gotham City, and Batman developed a veritable rogues gallery of foes including the likes of\n   the Penguin\n   ,\n   Man-Bat\n   ,\n   Killer Croc\n   ,\n   Cluemaster\n   and\n   Catwoman\n   .\n  \n\n   One of the most traumatic experiences in Bruce's career as the Batman not only cost him a friend, but also gave rise to a powerful new villain. The Joker, having once again escaped custody, developed a special vaporous gel that could transform everything it came into contact with into putty. The Joker kidnapped Ethan Bennett and held him captive at his lair where upon he forced him to inhale the vapors from his gel. Bennett survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Batman and Ellen Yin, but exposure to the chemicals altered his physical structure, slowly transforming his body into liquid clay. Driven insane, Ethan Bennett became the villain known as Clayface.\n  \n\n   Some time later, a new character entered the Batman's life, but this one came not as a foe, but as an ally.\n   Barbara Gordon\n   , the teenage daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner\n   James Gordan\n   , took it upon herself to adopt her own costumed identity – Batgirl. While keeping her identity safely hidden from her father, Barbara aided Batman in stopping her former friend\n   Poison Ivy\n   from terrorizing the Chlorogene corporation. Batman was reluctant to accept Barbara's aid, and provided little encouragement, but the enthusiastic youth persevered and continued to assist Batman as his unofficial partner. After several harrowing adventures, including one which required Batgirl to man the Bat-Bot armor, Batman finally accepted her as his partner and provided her with her own utility belt.\n  \n\n   The \"Batman Family\" gained another member only a short time later. Young circus aerialist\n   Dick Grayson\n   was orphaned when his parents were murdered by a criminal named\n   Tony Zucco\n   . Batman felt great empathy towards Dick, having experienced a similar horror as a youth himself. Recognizing Dick's acrobatic skill, he took him under his wing at the Batcave and Dick became his new sidekick Robin. This relationship caused a rivalry between Dick and Barbara who felt that Dick was receiving preferential treatment over her. Over time however, the two teens mended bridges and became an effective fighting force.\n  \n\n   Some time later, Bruce discovered that Wayne Industries had begun secretly distributing alien technology to different locations across the world. While investigating the matter, Batman encountered a shape-shifting Martian who called himself\n   John Jones\n   . After a brief fight, Jones proved to him that he was actually here to aid the Batman and warned him of an encroaching alien armada called\n   the Joining\n   . As predicted, the Joining entered Earth's atmosphere and attacked Gotham City. Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Jones and the Gotham City police department fought valiantly against the aliens, saving as many lives as possible. They were finally able to repel the invasion by way of a satellite relay system. Although humanity proved victorious, Gotham City suffered tremendous collateral damage. This event proved to Batman that he could be more effective by combining his efforts with other like-minded heroes. At John's behest, he joined a team of super-heroes called the Justice League. Together he would join the league to battle many foes such as\n   Lex Luthor\n   .\n  \n\n   At some point later, in the year 2027,\n   Mr. Freeze\n   had attacked an airport in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne, now much older, took up the mantle of Batman again. Using a now tank-like Batmobile, he confronted Freeze, who overpowered the aging Dark Knight. Notified by Barbara Gordon, who was confined to a wheelchair and going by the name Oracle, Dick Grayson arrived, now the superhero named\n   Nightwing\n   . Nightwing and Batman fought Freeze, and succeeded in stopping him, but not forever.\n  \n\n   One thousand years later, Freeze began terrorizing the future Gotham City. Archeologists unearthed the Batcave with hopes of stopping Freeze. After theorizing that Thomas Wayne was Batman, and that his son Bruce was Robin, as well as several other theories, the archeologists discovered binary code incribed in the Batcave's titanium structure. Using holograms, they defeated Freeze, and imprisoned him, making sure that Batman's legacy survived into the future.\n  \n\n\n    Appearance\n   \n\n\n   Batman’s bat costume consists of a black mask and cape and gold utility belt, except with dark blue highlights. He also wears a dark gray costume with a black bat-emblem, black trunks, gloves, and knee high boots.\n  \n\n\n    Powers and Abilities\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Master Acrobat:\n    \n    Excellent in gymnastics and acrobatics.\n   \n\n\n     Peak Human Conditioning:\n    \n    Through intense training, Batman represents the pinnacle of human physical potential.

Batman is a superhero co-created by artist\n   \n    Bob Kane\n   \n   and writer\n   \n    Bill Finger\n   \n   . The character made his first appearance in\n   \n\n     Detective Comics\n    \n    #27\n   \n   (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of\n   \n    Bruce Wayne\n   \n   . Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the\n   \n    Batcave\n   \n   , beneath\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   assisted by his butler\n   \n    Alfred Pennyworth\n   \n   . The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.\n  \n\n   Batman became a popular character soon after his introduction, and eventually gained his own title, \"Batman\". As the decades wore on, differing takes on the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series utilized a camp aesthetic associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in\n   \n    Frank Miller\n   \n   's\n   \n    1986\n    \n     Dark Knight\n    \n    series\n   \n   . That and the success of director\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 Batman motion picture helped reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world. The Batman goes by numerous nicknames, such as The Dark Knight, The Caped Crusader, World's Greatest Detective and the Defender of Gotham.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       History\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n\n          Early Life\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Golden Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Silver Age\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Modern Batman\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Knightfall\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Batman R.I.P.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.7\n        \n\n         \"Death\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.8\n        \n\n         Return\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.9\n        \n\n         New 52\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.10\n        \n\n         DC Rebirth\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.11\n        \n\n         The Joker War\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.12\n        \n\n         Infinite Frontier\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Personality\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Relationships\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Family\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Romances\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Allies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.4\n        \n\n         Enemies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Abilities\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Paraphernalia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Equipment\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           5.1.1\n          \n\n           Former Equipment\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Weapons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Transportation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Other Media\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Notes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    History\n   \n\n\n\n    For key points in Batman's history see\n    Batman's publication history\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Early Life\n    \n\n\n\n   Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable\n   \n    Gotham City\n   \n   socialites. Bruce was brought up in\n   \n    Wayne Manor\n   \n   and its wealthy splendor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight. While returning home one night, his parents were killed by a small-time criminal named\n   \n    Joe Chill\n   \n   . After the incident, Bruce swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives.\n  \n\n   As he grows up, Bruce engages in intense intellectual and physical training. He also travels abroad, training in various martial arts, fields of science, criminology and detective skills. After returning to Gotham, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to assume the persona of Batman.\n  \n\n\n    Golden Age\n   \n\n\n   In the early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante initially earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named Julie Madison. Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department. During this time, butler Alfred arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.\n  \n\n\n    Silver Age\n   \n\n\n   After the introduction of DC Comics' multi-verse in the 1960s, it is retroactively established that stories from the Golden Age star the\n   \n    Earth-Two Batman\n   \n   , a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two\n   \n    Catwoman\n   \n   , Selina Kyle (as shown in Superman Family #211) and fathers Helena Wayne, who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with the Earth-Two Robin) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208, Jan./Feb. 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.\n  \n\n   Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably\n   \n    Superman\n   \n   , whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the\n   \n    Justice League of America\n   \n   , appearing in its first story in 1960s Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.\n  \n\n   In 1969,\n   \n    Dick Grayson\n   \n   attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or\n   \n    Batgirl\n   \n   . Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of an insane, murderous\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   , and the arrival of\n   \n    Ra's Al Ghul\n   \n   . In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes\n   \n    Nightwing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called\n   \n    the Outsiders\n   \n   .

    "question": "who played batman the most on tv?",
    "response": "Adam West played Batman the most on TV, appearing in 120 episodes of the 1966-1968 live-action series. This makes him the actor with the longest on-screen tenure as the character in a single TV show. For context, Kevin Conroy voiced Batman in 85 episodes of \"Batman: The Animated Series\" (1992-1995), but West's episode count is higher based on the available information. If you're exploring Batman history, West's portrayal became a pop culture icon, influencing how the character is viewed in media.",

He played opposite Chuck Connors in\n   \n    Geronimo\n   \n   (1962) and Joe DeRita in\n   \n    The Outlaws Is Coming\n   \n   (1965). He also appeared in the science fiction film,\n   \n    Robinson Crusoe on Mars\n   \n   (1964) alongside Paul Mantee, and, unsurprisingly, achieved continuing success for the title role in the 1960s ABC series\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   and its theatrical feature film.\n  \n\n   West was contacted for a screen test after\n   William Dozier\n   saw West perform as the James Bond-like spy Captain Q in a Nestlé Quik television ad. West was in competition with Lyle Waggoner (who later acted out Steve Trevor and, later, his lookalike son Steve Trevor Jr. in the 1970s television version of\n   \n\n     Wonder Woman\n    \n\n   which starred Lynda Carter in the title role) for the Batman role. West became the third actor to play Bruce Wayne/Batman in live action, succeeding\n   Robert Lowery\n   .\n  \n\n   The popular show, which was deliberately produced as a lampoon comedy but drew accusations of being \"campy\" that bothered West throughout his entire career, ran on ABC from 1966 to 1968; a film version was released in July of 1966. At this time, the DC Comics that were featuring Batman himself were experiencing dismal sales, and were threatened with cancellation after approximately twenty-five years; West, when he dictated his autobiography,\n   \n    Back To The Batcave,\n   \n   to Jeff Rovin, pointed out that the \"Batuation comedy\" saved Batman's DC Comics from cancellation and enabled a new generation to get to know the character as he had originally been created.\n  \n\n\n    Return Performances as Batman\n   \n\n\n   West often reprised his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, first in the short-lived animated series\n   \n    The New Adventures of Batman\n   \n   and later in other shows such as\n   \n    The Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour,\n   \n\n    Tarzan and the Super 7,\n   \n\n    Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show,\n   \n   and\n   \n    The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians;\n   \n   he succeeded Olan Soule in this last role. In 1979, West once again donned the Bat-Costume for the live-action TV special\n   \n    Legends of the Superheroes\n   \n   . In 1985, DC Comics named West as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication\n   \n    Fifty Who Made DC Great\n   \n   for his work on the\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   series. In 1997 West returned to the Role of Bruce Wayne/Batman for the first time in 12 years for the animated short \"Boo Wonder\" on the animated TV series\n   \n    Animaniacs.\n   \n   In one installment of\n   \n    Batman: The Animated Series,\n   \n   he provided the character voice of an actor whose career had stalled due to typecasting as a Batman-like character called \"The Gray Ghost.\" (See below.) In 2016, and again in 2017, West returned to voice Batman in two animated features,\n   \n    Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders\n   \n   and\n   \n    Batman vs Two Face!\n   \n   Both animated features were based on the original 1960s TV series. The latter was released posthumously and proved to be West's final work; deathly ill with leukemia during the recording sessions for\n   \n    Batman Versus Two-Face!\n   \n   though he worked through his illness, he died between his having finished recording all his dialog and the film's release.\n  \n\n\n    1992 Installment: Simon Trent\n   \n\n\n   West provided a character voice for a 1992 installment of\n   \n    Batman: The Animated Series\n   \n   on Fox, but\n   \n    NOT\n   \n   that of Batman, since the character voice of\n   Batman\n   was already being provided by\n   Kevin Conroy\n   . Instead, he provided the character voice of\n   Simon Trent\n   , an out-of-work actor who had once acted out a super-hero similar to Batman himself in a TV series called\n   \n    The Gray Ghost,\n   \n   and who was now considered a washed-up had-been as far as motion pictures and television went; he now had a great deal of difficulty finding acting work due to typecasting. The producers nearly considered scrapping that installment as they figured it mirrored Adam West too much; however, West had already made his peace with his public identification as Batman, and he gladly accepted voicing such a character.\n  \n\n\n    Mayor Grange Voice\n   \n\n\n   West later had a recurring role as the voice of Mayor Grange in the WB animated series\n   \n    The Batman\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n    CGI File: Batman\n   \n\n\n   The actor vocally reprised his role as Batman for the CGI animated short film\n   \n    Batman: New Times\n   \n   . He co-starred with\n   Mark Hamill\n   , who vocally portrayed the\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   and had originally played the role on\n   \n    Batman: The Animated Series.\n   \n   West also voiced\n   \n    Thomas Wayne\n   \n   , Bruce Wayne's father, in an episode of the cartoon series\n   \n\n     Batman: The Brave and the Bold\n    \n    .\n   \n   In the same series, he played Batman's prototype robot, aptly named \"Protobot,\" or \"Proto\" for short. He also did voice work on animated series such as\n   \n    The Fairly OddParents\n   \n   and\n   \n    Family Guy,\n   \n   in both of which he voiced fictional versions of himself.\n  \n\n\n    In comics\n   \n\n\n   BlueWater Comics published\n   \n    The Mis-Adventures of Adam West,\n   \n   which told the adventures of West in various movie parodies where he, a classic hero type who rejected the darkening nature of heroes in films, would always save the day.

The original episodes, produced by Bruce Timm and\n   Eric Radomski\n   , were first aired on the Fox Network from 1992 to 1995. When the first season of the series aired on weekday afternoons, it lacked an on-screen title in the opening credits and was known only as\n   \n\n     Batman\n    \n\n   (and would be referred to as such in episode recaps that summarized what had happened \"previously on\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   ...\") When its timeslot was moved to weekends for the second series, it was named\n   \n\n     The Adventures of Batman & Robin\n    \n\n   , a title originally used in the 1969-1970 animated series created by Filmation, to emphasize the crime fighting partnership of the characters and allow younger audiences to become more familiar with\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   , who would shortly afterwards feature in the 1995 film\n   \n\n     Batman Forever\n    \n\n   .\n  \n\n   The series was the first of what fans refer to as the DC Animated Universe (DCAU), a shared continuity of Batman shows throughout the 1990s culminating in a Justice League cartoon in the early 2000s.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Overview\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Creation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Acclaim\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n\n          The New Batman Adventures\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Influence\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.1\n        \n\n         New characters\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.2\n        \n\n         Bruce Wayne\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Bat Equipment\n      \n\n\n\n\n      4\n     \n\n      Episodes\n     \n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n         Lost episode\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Theatrical and direct-to-video releases\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Cast\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.1\n        \n\n         Main Protagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.2\n        \n\n         Supporting protagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.3\n        \n\n         Main antagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.4\n        \n\n         Supporting antagonists\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Videos\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Overview\n   \n\n\n\n    Creation\n   \n\n\n   The original series was partially inspired by\n   \n    Tim Burton\n   \n   's 1989 blockbuster\n   \n\n     Batman\n    \n\n   film and the acclaimed Superman cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios in the 1940s. Timm and Radomski designed the series by closely emulating the Tim Burton films' \"otherworldly timelessness,\" incorporating period features such as black-and-white title cards, police blimps, 40s influenced fashion, 40s influenced car styling and a \"vintage\" color scheme in a largely film noir-influenced style. The series initially took as its theme a variation of music written by\n   \n    Danny Elfman\n   \n   for Burton's Batman film; later episodes of the series used a new theme with a similar style by Shirley Walker. The score of the series was influenced by Elfman and Walker's work on\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   and\n   \n\n     Batman Returns\n    \n\n   and the music of 40s film noir. The art style of the original animated series was also partially a reaction against the realism seen in shows like\n   \n    X-Men\n   \n   ; the second series in some ways was a further extension of that rejection of realism.\n  \n\n   Like\n   \n    X-Men\n   \n   , the program was much more adult oriented than previous typical superhero cartoon series. In their constant quest to make the show darker, the producers pushed the boundaries of action cartoons: it was the first such cartoon in years to depict firearms being fired instead of laser guns (only one person has ever been actually depicted as shot;\n   Commissioner Gordon\n   in episode 49 was seen to have a gunshot wound after the firefight was finished), Batman actually punching and kicking the antagonists, as well as the existence of blood (such as Batman having a trail of blood from his mouth); in addition, many of the series' backgrounds were painted on black paper. The distinctive visual combination of film noir imagery and Art Deco designs with a very dark color scheme was called \"Dark Deco\" by the producers. First-time producers Timm and Radomski reportedly encountered resistance from studio executives, but the success of Burton's first film allowed the embryonic series to survive long enough to produce a pilot episode, \"\n   On Leather Wings\n   \", which according to Timm \"got a lot of people off our backs.\"\n  \n\n\n    Acclaim\n   \n\n\n   The Emmy Award-winning series quickly received wide acclaim for its distinctive animation and mature writing, and it instantly became a hit. Fans of a wide age range praised the show's sophisticated, cinematic tone, character depth and psychological stories. Voice-actor\n   Kevin Conroy\n   used two distinct voices to portray Bruce Wayne and Batman, as\n   \n    Michael Keaton\n   \n   had done in the films. This series also featured a supporting cast that included major actors performing the voices of the various classic villains, most notably\n   Mark Hamill\n   , who defined a whole new career for himself in animation with his portrayal of\n   \n    Joker\n   \n   . The voice recording sessions were recorded with the actors together in a studio, like a radio play, unlike most animated films, in which the principal voice actors record separately and never meet (various interviews have noted that such an arrangement (having the cast record together) was a benefit to the show as a whole, as the actors were able to 'react' to one another, rather than simply 'reading the words').\n  \n\n   Key to the series' artistic success is that it managed to redefine classic characters, paying homage to their previous portrayals while giving them new dramatic force. The characterization of villains such as\n   \n    Two-Face\n   \n   and the\n   Mad Hatter\n   and heroes like\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   (who had not appeared in the Burton film series) demonstrate this.\n   The Penguin\n   is based upon his appearance in\n   \n    Batman Returns\n   \n   , which was being released at the same time as the series. The series also gave new life to nearly forgotten characters like the\n   Clock King\n   . An often noted example of dramatic change is\n   \n    Mr. Freeze\n   \n   ;\n   \n    Batman: TAS\n   \n   turned him from a clichéd mad scientist with a gimmick for cold, to a tragic figure whose frigid exterior hides a doomed love and a cold vindictive fury. Part of the tragedy is mimicked later in the plot of\n   \n    Joel Schumacher\n   \n   's live action movie\n   \n\n     Batman & Robin\n    \n\n   , although much of the drama was lost with the resurrection of the pun-quipping mad scientist image. Another example of dramatic change is\n   Clayface\n   , a character who to fans is believed to be far more intriguing to an audience due to his tragic past and almost 'sane' way of dealing with situations, and later influenced DC to recreate their version of the character to fit the animated universes. The most famous of the series' innovations is the Joker's hapless assistant,\n   Harley Quinn\n   , who became so popular that DC Comics later added her to the mainstream Batman comic continuity.\n  \n\n   This series became a cornerstone of the Warner Bros.' animation department, which became one of the top producers of television animation. For years, Warner Bros. Animation had been known only for doing Looney Tunes and their offshoots such as\n   \n    Tiny Toon Adventures\n   \n   . This was Warner's first attempt at doing a serious animated cartoon and it ended up working better than they thought. It also sparked a large franchise of similar TV adaptations of DC Comics characters. Despite the marketing decision by Warner Bros. of making the series a Saturday morning cartoon, Producer Bruce Timm and the crew were not interested in making a show aimed squarely at small children.\n  \n\n\n\n\n      The New Batman Adventures\n     \n\n\n\n\n   A completely new version of the series was launched to match the more efficient animation style of\n   \n    Superman: The Animated Series\n   \n   . It also opened up possibilities for crossovers. All characters, vehicles and props were redesigned, with the exception of\n   \n    Two-Face\n   \n   .\n   \n\n     The New Batman Adventures\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n\n     Batman Beyond\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Justice League\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Justice League Unlimited\n    \n\n   all form a continuity that fans refer to as the \"DC Animated Universe.\"\n  \n\n\n    Influence\n   \n\n\n\n    New characters\n   \n\n\n   New villains like\n   Red Claw\n   , the ninja\n   Kyodai Ken\n   , and the\n   Sewer King\n   were invented for the series, but to little acclaim.

Never before having read comic books, he formed the idea, when he did read the Batman comics, to produce the series as a lampoon, villain-driven and heavy on action comedy. (Dozier himself explained this, in his last years, to Joel Eisner when the latter wrote\n   \n    The Official\n    \n     Batman\n    \n    Batbook.\n   \n   ) The studio through which\n   \n    Batman\n   \n   would be produced,\n   \n    Twentieth-Century Fox Television,\n   \n   had demonstrated its ability to meet the high-pressure deadlines that the show would demand, having already so succeeded with\n   \n    Peyton Place,\n   \n   based on the novel by Grace Metalious.\n  \n\n   When the earliest installments, \"\n   Hi Diddle Riddle\n   \"/\"\n   Smack In The Middle\n   ,\" were initially screened in a time before the mapping of audience demographics was successfully refined to a science, their ratings were, ironically, unusually low!\n  \n\n\n    Premise\n   \n\n\n   Premiering on January 12, 1966, as a mid-season replacement, the series featured actor\n   Adam West\n   as the perennial character of Batman, while\n   Burt Ward\n   donned heavy-duty nylon stockings and fairy boots for his portrayal of Batman's so-called \"side-kick\" and protege, Robin. Jan Kemp executed the designs of those Batcostumes, neither wearer of which found them very comfortable.\n  \n\n   The show was noteworthy for its memorable use of onomatopoeia during climactic fight scenes. The show quickly became a huge success with audiences, and transformed West and Ward into modern pop culture icons.\n  \n\n   When not fighting crime as Batman and Robin, the Dynamic Duo were often found at \"stately\"\n   \n    Wayne Manor,\n   \n   the Wayne family mansion, in their respective identities as Bruce Wayne and his \"youthful ward,\" Dick Grayson. Living alongside them in the vast mansion was doddering old Aunt Harriet Cooper, based upon a minor character in the comics who had been added to give the Bat-Duo reason to be secretive about their dual identities, and their mild-mannered butler and majordomo, Alfred. Alfred was the only other person to know Batman and Robin's secret identities. Aunt Harriet could not be allowed that knowledge for two reasons; first, for Bruce and Dick to have been able to lounge around in their Batcostumes would have been at least marginally undercutting to the drama; and second, knowing the Bat-Duo's identities might have caused her more danger than they wanted her to have to face. (Dozier, however, told Eisner--based upon his own incorrect recollections--that the Aunt Harriet character had been added to prevent Bruce and Dick from looking like they were gay in those unfortunately homophobic days and, thereby, to defuse the accusations that Frederic Wertham had made in\n   \n    Seduction Of The Innocent,\n   \n   an anti-comics book that blamed comics for causing harm to younger readers, but was later recognized as having promoted junk science and being based largely on data fudging.)\n  \n\n   One major difference about the heroes compared between television and other media, the Batman and Robin of the TV series (and the adapted 1966 film) were fully deputized law enforcement officers, a point emphasized on more than one occasion by Commissioner Gordon, whereas in the comics and later films they were viewed (by police and the public at large) as vigilantes.\n  \n\n   Unlike the earlier movie serials of the 1940s, this was the first Batman project to feature Batman's rogues gallery of villains. Cesar Romero made numerous appearances as the Joker, while Burgess Meredith reinvented the image of the Penguin, with his crooked smile and trademark \"Squawk\". Julie Newmar provided Catwoman's rolling \"R\"s, only to be replaced later by Lee Meriwether for the 1966 movie, and again in the final season by Eartha Kitt. Two men provided their talents to the role of the Riddler - Frank Gorshin (in the first and third seasons) and John Astin (in a one-off second-season appearance).\n  \n\n   In addition to the fantastic sets and costumes, the series also featured a number of James Bond-inspired gadget-filled vehicles: Batmobile (which had originated in the comics), Batcycle, Batboat, and the Batcopter. The Batmobile donor car was a 1955 Lincoln Futura that George Barris customized in only three weeks. Two Batcycles appeared on the show; the first was a barely modified Harley Davidson, and the second was a highly modified Yamaha. The Batboat was built by Glastron. Some of the specialty vehicles - in particular the Batboat and Batcopter - were constructed under the budget for the 1966 film.\n  \n\n\n    Schedule\n   \n\n\n   During its first two seasons, the series aired twice a week, with each week featuring a two-part story, with the exception of a one-off three-part Penguin story that aired midway through season 2. As a result, season 1 aired for 34 episodes, while season 2 aired for a massive 60 episodes, at a time when most US prime-time series only aired 25 or so episodes a season. In season 3 the series was scaled back to once a week and the show began mixing up the formula by airing a mixture of single-episode, two-part and three-part storylines. Only 20 episodes were made that year.\n  \n\n   The second season was produced immediately after the feature film, with neither crew nor cast giving themselves time to figure out what direction the show would take.\n  \n\n   By season three, declining ratings prompted the introduction of a third partner to the Bat Family, Barbara Gordon – aka Batgirl (played by Yvonne Craig). Adam West admitted to Jeff Rovin, in\n   \n    Back To The Batcave,\n   \n   that he resented how \"calculating and titillating\" the show had become, pointing out that those approaches to such problems afflicting series television are always inherently short-range, though he became fond of Yvonne Craig herself. Although Batgirl was a popular character, her presence could not save the series, and it was canceled in 1968.\n  \n\n\n    Other media\n   \n\n\n   The series spun-off a motion picture in 1966 featuring most of the TV cast. After its cancellation, West and Ward continued to portray Batman and Robin in voice only for several Saturday morning-cartoon versions of Batman, and appeared on screen once more as the Dynamic Duo in the two-part comedy special \"Legends of the Superheroes\" which aired in 1979 and also featured Frank Gorshin returning as the Riddler.\n  \n\n   In 2003, West, Ward, Newmar, Gorshin, and Meriwether, as well as Lyle Waggoner, the actor considered for the role of Batman before Adam West, appeared in the TV movie\n   \n    Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt,\n   \n   a tongue-in-cheek film in which West and Ward, appearing as themselves, reminisced about making the TV series. Based upon the two actors's memoirs, the film featured recreations of various scenes and behind-the-scenes events from filming. Jack Brewer plays young Adam West, Jason Marsden assails the role of young Burt Ward, and Julie Rose plays young Julie Newmar, among other. The film is notable for allowing Frank Gorshin to film a scene on a recreated Batcave set - he was one of the only recurring rogue's gallery actors never to get the chance on TV - and is the only Batman production to feature bot",

    "question": "What is Supernanny?",
    "response": "Supernanny is a reality TV series that helps families address parenting challenges, particularly with children's behavior issues. It originated in the UK on Channel 4 in 2004, hosted by Jo Frost, a childcare expert who provides practical techniques like the Naughty Step, Reward Charts, and Positive Praise to improve family dynamics. The show expanded internationally, with versions in countries like the US (on ABC and Lifetime), France, Germany, and others, often featuring \"submission reels\" from families and focusing on real-life interventions. In the US, it ran for multiple seasons, emphasizing shared parenting strategies and gaining popularity, though it faced controversy for depicting corporal punishment and abuse. Overall, Supernanny highlights effective parenting methods and has influenced discussions on family education worldwide.",

    "response": "Supernanny is a reality television series that helps families improve their parenting skills and manage challenging child behavior. Originating in the UK in 2004 and expanding to various international versions, the show features child care expert Jo Frost, who visits struggling households, observes family dynamics, and implements practical techniques like reward charts, time-outs (e.g., the Naughty Step), and positive praise to address issues such as tantrums, disobedience, and sibling conflicts. The format typically includes initial assessments, technique demonstrations, and follow-up to show progress, with the overall purpose of promoting effective discipline, stronger family bonds, and better child development.",

He is best known for his work in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy of films, consisting of Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), and The World's End (2013), and the television comedy Spaced (1999–2001). He also appeared in Joe Cornish's film Attack the Block (2011). He co-starred in the 2011 film Paul, which he co-wrote with frequent collaborator and friend Simon Pegg. He is also well known for his various roles in the sketch show Man Stroke Woman.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Early life\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Career\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Personal life\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Accounts\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Early life\n   \n\n\n   Frost was born in Dagenham, London, the son of Tricia (d. 2005) and John Frost, office furniture designers. When he was ten, his sister died of an asthma attack aged 18. He attended Beal High School in Ilford. When Frost was 15 his parents' business failed and they lost the family home. They moved in with neighbours where he witnessed his mother having a stroke due to the stress. Frost left school and took a job with a shipping company to support the family. He subsequently spent two years at a kibbutz in Israel. He met actor Simon Pegg while working as a waiter at a North London Mexican restaurant and the two became close friends and flatmates. Pegg and Jessica Hynes wrote a role for Frost in the cult slacker comedy series Spaced that was partly based on Pegg and Frost's lifestyle at the time.\n  \n\n\n    Career\n   \n\n\n   He appeared in corporate training video clips such as Chris Carter and the Coverplan Challenge, a Dixons sales video, before gaining fame as Tim's army-obsessed best friend Mike in Spaced (1999–2001), which aired on Channel 4 for two series. In 2001, Frost played a small role in a one-off episode of Victoria Wood's Acorn Antiques. This was a specially written episode shown during the series called \"The Sketch Show Story\" that Victoria narrated, in which Frost played an armed robber who shot dead Acorn Antiques' most lovable character, Mrs Overall.\n  \n\n   In 2002, Frost wrote and presented the show Danger! 50,000 Volts!, a spoof of the outdoors survival genre in which SAS experts or the like demonstrated how to improvise solutions to dangerous problems. In the same year, Frost co-wrote and starred in The Sofa of Time with Matt King. In 2004, he appeared in Shaun of the Dead, a \"romantic zombie comedy\", written by Simon Pegg and Spaced director Edgar Wright. In late 2005, Frost starred in the comedy sketch show Man Stroke Woman on BBC Three. A second series of Man Stroke Woman aired on BBC Three in early 2007. In early 2006, Frost played Commander Henderson in two series of the BBC Two science fiction sitcom, Hyperdrive. Also in 2006, he acted in Kinky Boots. Frost had a small appearance in the British comedy Look Around You, a parody of 1970s/1980s technology parodying the format of shows like Tomorrow's World.\n  \n\n   Frost and Pegg appeared in a second Pegg-Wright feature film called Hot Fuzz, an action and cop genre homage, set in Gloucestershire. Frost plays bumbling Constable Danny Butterman, who partners up with Pegg's dynamic Nicholas Angel after the latter is transferred from the Metropolitan Police in London. The pair teamed up again for their self-penned 2011 science-fiction comedy film Paul, whose storyline concerned a fugitive alien. The two also starred in Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn as Thomson and Thompson. Frost narrates the Channel 4 reality show\n   \n    Supernanny\n   \n   . He has made fleeting appearances in the Channel 4 surreal medical comedy series Green Wing as \"just a man\" in pub scenes (when Boyce asks who he is, he responds, \"just a man\"). In 2013, Frost played the role of Andy Knightley in the third Pegg-Wright feature film called The World's End. In 2014, he played the eponymous character in the Sky Atlantic comedy, Mr. Sloane.\n  \n\n   In 2016, Frost was cast in an ensemble role for the second season of the AMC television series, Into the Badlands.\n  \n\n\n    Personal life\n   \n\n\n   Frost is good friends with fellow actor Simon Pegg and the two have appeared alongside each other in several films. In a 2005 interview, Frost stated that he was brought up as a Catholic but is now an atheist, as is Simon Pegg. He is a supporter of West Ham United, as well as being a rugby player, formerly playing for Barking RFC.\n  \n\n   Frost lived with his half-Swedish wife, production executive Christina, in St Margarets, London. They married in 2008. He previously lived in Finsbury Park, which was also the filming location for Shaun of the Dead. On 22 June 2011, Christina gave birth to the couple's son. They separated in 2013, and later divorced.\n  \n\n   In October 2015, Frost released a memoir titled Truths, Half Truths & Little White Lies (Hodder & Stoughton), detailing his life up to the age of 30.\n  \n\n   Frost is a patron of Humanists UK.\n  \n\n\n    Accounts\n   \n\n\n\n    Twitter\n   \n\n    Instagram\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Episode\n     \n\n      8\n     \n\n\n\n      Air Date\n     \n\n      January 8, 2010\n     \n\n\n\n      Techniques\n     \n\n      Chore Buddies\n      ,\n      Reflection Room\n      , Homework Time\n     \n\n\n\n      Season\n     \n\n      6\n     \n\n\n\n      Previous\n     \n\n      The Heredia Family\n     \n\n\n\n      Next\n     \n\n\n       The Hallenbeck Family\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n      1\n     \n\n      Episode summary\n     \n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Family members\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Behind The Scenes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Episode summary\n   \n\n\n   Jo heads off to Florence, South Carolina to meet Greg (44) and Amber Benton (33) with their two chaotic boys: River (10) and Hunter (8)  River is dependent on his parents, and Hunter is very strong-willed.

    "question": "What is a Supernanny at all? Movie series? ",
    "response": "Supernanny is not a movie series; it's a reality television show that focuses on family dynamics and parenting advice. It originated in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 in 2004, hosted by Jo Frost, who helps struggling families implement techniques like reward charts and time-outs to manage children's behavior. The show became internationally popular, with versions produced in countries like the US (on ABC and Lifetime), France, and Germany, and it has aired in over 47 territories. Its format involves real families sharing their challenges on camera, making it more of a documentary-style series rather than scripted movies. Culturally, it's notable for its impact on parenting discussions but has faced controversy over its depiction of discipline.

He is best known for his work in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy of films, consisting of Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), and The World's End (2013), and the television comedy Spaced (1999–2001). He also appeared in Joe Cornish's film Attack the Block (2011). He co-starred in the 2011 film Paul, which he co-wrote with frequent collaborator and friend Simon Pegg. He is also well known for his various roles in the sketch show Man Stroke Woman.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Early life\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Career\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Personal life\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Accounts\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Early life\n   \n\n\n   Frost was born in Dagenham, London, the son of Tricia (d. 2005) and John Frost, office furniture designers. When he was ten, his sister died of an asthma attack aged 18. He attended Beal High School in Ilford. When Frost was 15 his parents' business failed and they lost the family home. They moved in with neighbours where he witnessed his mother having a stroke due to the stress. Frost left school and took a job with a shipping company to support the family. He subsequently spent two years at a kibbutz in Israel. He met actor Simon Pegg while working as a waiter at a North London Mexican restaurant and the two became close friends and flatmates. Pegg and Jessica Hynes wrote a role for Frost in the cult slacker comedy series Spaced that was partly based on Pegg and Frost's lifestyle at the time.\n  \n\n\n    Career\n   \n\n\n   He appeared in corporate training video clips such as Chris Carter and the Coverplan Challenge, a Dixons sales video, before gaining fame as Tim's army-obsessed best friend Mike in Spaced (1999–2001), which aired on Channel 4 for two series. In 2001, Frost played a small role in a one-off episode of Victoria Wood's Acorn Antiques. This was a specially written episode shown during the series called \"The Sketch Show Story\" that Victoria narrated, in which Frost played an armed robber who shot dead Acorn Antiques' most lovable character, Mrs Overall.\n  \n\n   In 2002, Frost wrote and presented the show Danger! 50,000 Volts!, a spoof of the outdoors survival genre in which SAS experts or the like demonstrated how to improvise solutions to dangerous problems. In the same year, Frost co-wrote and starred in The Sofa of Time with Matt King. In 2004, he appeared in Shaun of the Dead, a \"romantic zombie comedy\", written by Simon Pegg and Spaced director Edgar Wright. In late 2005, Frost starred in the comedy sketch show Man Stroke Woman on BBC Three. A second series of Man Stroke Woman aired on BBC Three in early 2007. In early 2006, Frost played Commander Henderson in two series of the BBC Two science fiction sitcom, Hyperdrive. Also in 2006, he acted in Kinky Boots. Frost had a small appearance in the British comedy Look Around You, a parody of 1970s/1980s technology parodying the format of shows like Tomorrow's World.\n  \n\n   Frost and Pegg appeared in a second Pegg-Wright feature film called Hot Fuzz, an action and cop genre homage, set in Gloucestershire. Frost plays bumbling Constable Danny Butterman, who partners up with Pegg's dynamic Nicholas Angel after the latter is transferred from the Metropolitan Police in London. The pair teamed up again for their self-penned 2011 science-fiction comedy film Paul, whose storyline concerned a fugitive alien. The two also starred in Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn as Thomson and Thompson. Frost narrates the Channel 4 reality show\n   \n    Supernanny\n   \n   . He has made fleeting appearances in the Channel 4 surreal medical comedy series Green Wing as \"just a man\" in pub scenes (when Boyce asks who he is, he responds, \"just a man\"). In 2013, Frost played the role of Andy Knightley in the third Pegg-Wright feature film called The World's End. In 2014, he played the eponymous character in the Sky Atlantic comedy, Mr. Sloane.\n  \n\n   In 2016, Frost was cast in an ensemble role for the second season of the AMC television series, Into the Badlands.\n  \n\n\n    Personal life\n   \n\n\n   Frost is good friends with fellow actor Simon Pegg and the two have appeared alongside each other in several films. In a 2005 interview, Frost stated that he was brought up as a Catholic but is now an atheist, as is Simon Pegg. He is a supporter of West Ham United, as well as being a rugby player, formerly playing for Barking RFC.\n  \n\n   Frost lived with his half-Swedish wife, production executive Christina, in St Margarets, London. They married in 2008. He previously lived in Finsbury Park, which was also the filming location for Shaun of the Dead. On 22 June 2011, Christina gave birth to the couple's son. They separated in 2013, and later divorced.\n  \n\n   In October 2015, Frost released a memoir titled Truths, Half Truths & Little White Lies (Hodder & Stoughton), detailing his life up to the age of 30.\n  \n\n   Frost is a patron of Humanists UK.\n  \n\n\n    Accounts\n   \n\n\n\n    Twitter\n   \n\n    Instagram\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Its primary use is to raise awareness about the hidden dangers of sleep deprivation among UK children and provide practical guidance for parents.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its purpose and benefits:\n- **Purpose**: The study investigates how insufficient sleep affects children's behavior, school performance, and overall well-being. Jo Frost collaborates with experts like Dr. Cathy Hill to monitor a group of 10-year-olds, tracking their sleep habits and observing real impacts, such as increased tantrums, poor concentration, and emotional instability. It also addresses family dynamics, as seen with Michael, who exhibits controlling behavior potentially linked to inconsistent routines.\n  \n- **Benefits**: By highlighting the need for adequate sleep (e.g., 10-12 hours for 10-year-olds), the study helps parents understand how proper sleep routines can reduce behavioral issues, improve health (like better immune function and cognitive development), and enhance family harmony. For instance, it shows that sleep-deprived children may struggle with schoolwork or become more prone to conflicts, emphasizing the long-term advantages of establishing consistent bedtimes.\n\nTo apply this in real-world scenarios, such as parenting:\n- **Actionable Steps**: Start by assessing your child's sleep needs based on their age (e.g., aim for 10-13 hours for school-aged kids). Create a calming bedtime routine, like limiting screen time (as seen with consoles in the episode) and enforcing a set bedtime. If tantrums occur, use techniques like the \"Stay in Bed\" method from Supernanny to reinforce boundaries without giving in. Monitor changes in behavior to track improvements, and consult experts if needed.\n\nThis information can help you implement similar principles at home, promoting healthier habits and preventing issues like those in the episode.",
    "context": "\n\n\n\n\n   The Bye Bye Bottle is a technique that was first introduced in the\n   Christiansen Family\n   episode of Season 1 of the US edition of Supernanny.\nIn this technique, the parent explains the child will no longer get drinks via a bottle, and only offers a cup because he/she is a big boy/girl now. This Technique often caused a lot of tantrums.\n  \n\n\n    Bye Bye Bottle steps\n   \n\n\n   1. Get replacement cup\n  \n\n   2. Explain to child he/she is too old for the bottle. Or if you know your child is too old the best time to do this technique is when your child is not around you or at night when they are sleeping. That way they won't notice or know that their baby bottle is gone.\n  \n\n   3. Don’t give in when child throws a tantrum.\n  \n\n   4. Dispose of bottle.\n  \n\n   Parents can also buy a soft bottle toy (plush) if the child is in a major meltdown and he loved it so much.\n  \n\n\n    Christiansen Family\n   \n\n    The Ball Family\n   \n\n    Smith Family\n   \n\n    Newsome Family\n   \n\n\n\n    Video\n   \n\n\n   Bye Bye Bottle\n   on Supernanny US YouTube channel (Smith Family)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Opening\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Submission Reel\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Observation\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Observation begins\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Jordon & Jaydon fighting\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Kristin home from work\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.4\n        \n\n         Agreements over candy\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.5\n        \n\n         Computer time\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.6\n        \n\n         Observation ends\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Parent Meeting\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Teaching\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Teaching begins\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Jordon’s discipline & bedtime\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Kristin breaks down\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.4\n        \n\n         UMom Visit\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.5\n        \n\n         Teaching ends\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       DVD Meeting\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       Reinforcement\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         7.1\n        \n\n         Jo leaves for good and says goodbye\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Opening\n   \n\n\n\n    Submission Reel\n   \n\n\n   Jo: Well, i am in scorching hot Mesa, Arizona, on my way to a family who desperately need my help.

But how many parents actually know the number of hours sleep their kids really need?\n  \n\n   Jo wants to find out what effect having less sleep has on children.

    "question": "What is the key to raising someone elses kids?",
    "response": "The key to raising someone else's kids, such as in step-parenting or blended family situations, lies in building a foundation of trust, consistent discipline, and positive communication while prioritizing emotional support for everyone involved. Based on the Supernanny episodes you referenced, here's practical advice to implement this effectively:\n\n1. **Establish Consistent Discipline Techniques**: Use structured methods like a designated \"Naughty Spot\" (as seen in the Griswold episode) to address misbehavior calmly and fairly. For example, when a child acts out, guide them to the spot for a short, age-appropriate timeout, then follow up with a discussion about their actions and expectations. This helps set clear boundaries without resorting to punishment, reducing resentment and promoting self-regulation.\n\n2. **Foster Positive Communication and Emotional Support**: Open, honest conversations are crucial to build trust. In blended families like the one in the episode with Jack, Chloe, Demi, and Corey, encourage family meetings where everyone can express feelings without judgment. As a step-parent, focus on validating the child's emotions—e.g., acknowledge their loyalty to their biological parent—while modeling positive behavior. This can prevent issues like temper tantrums by making children feel heard and valued.\n\n3. **Build Trust Through Shared Activities and Patience**: Dedicate regular family time to strengthen bonds, as highlighted in the episodes. Start with small, fun activities to create positive associations, and be patient as relationships develop. Remember, trust takes time, especially if there are past disruptions, so avoid rushing authority and instead collaborate with the biological parent for a united front.\n\nBy applying these strategies consistently, you can create a supportive environment that minimizes behavioral outbursts and fosters long-term harmony. If challenges persist, consider seeking professional guidance, like the interventions in Supernanny, to tailor these approaches to your family.",

    "question": "who is supernanny?",
    "response": "Supernanny refers to both a popular reality TV series and its main host, Jo Frost, a British childcare expert. The show originated in the UK on Channel 4 in 2004, where Jo Frost helped families address behavioral issues in children using practical techniques like the Reward Chart, Naughty Step, Calm Zone, and Positive Praise. It became a global phenomenon, with adaptations broadcast in over 47 territories, including the US version on ABC starting in 2005, which ran for seven seasons and featured similar family interventions.\n\nJo Frost is the central figure, known for her no-nonsense approach to parenting, though the show has been controversial due to its depiction of family dynamics, including instances of corporal punishment and abuse counseling. In the US, the series influenced cultural discussions on child-rearing, emphasizing positive discipline and emotional management. For actionable knowledge, you can explore these techniques in real life: for example, a Reward Chart encourages good behavior through incentives, while the Naughty Step promotes time-outs for reflection. This show's success highlights its impact on modern parenting strategies.",

Kerry has a nine-year-old boy, Ryan, and her live-in boyfriend Steven, have three-year-old identical twin boys, David and Declan. Ryan has a daily routine of kicking and swearing, while Declan & David are prone to violent meltdowns.

    "question": "Who plays Alexander Hamilton in the Broadway show?",
    "response": "In the Broadway production of Hamilton, the role of Alexander Hamilton was originally played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the musical. Over time, due to cast changes, Javier Muñoz took over the role full-time on July 11, 2016, after initially serving as an alternate. More recently, as noted in the production history, actors like Miguel Cervantes have performed the role. This evolution in casting reflects the show's ongoing success and the way productions adapt with new talent.",

In 2015, President Barack Obama had decided to redesign the ten dollar bill, and put the face of an American woman on it. However, the global popularity of the musical Hamilton, made the US Treasury reconsider their decision. Mrs. Hillary Clinton, who was the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 as well as a fan of the Hamilton musical, told a New York Daily News editorial board meeting she'd \"keep Hamilton where he is.\" Ultimately, thanks to social media, political pressure and legendary hip-hop/rap music, Hamilton stayed on the ten dollar bill. Andrew Jackson, the 7th controversial President who supported slavery and the genocide of millions of Native Americans was removed from the twenty dollar bill. Harriet Tubman, a former slaver and the first women as well as first African-American person to be in charge of a military operation which freed thousands of slaves, now has her picture on the redesigned twenty dollar bill.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n    \"My name is Alexander Hamilton.

    "response": "The music in \"Alexander Hamilton,\" the opening song from the Broadway musical *Hamilton*, is primarily in the hip-hop genre, with strong elements of rap and rhythmic storytelling. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator, innovatively blends hip-hop with traditional musical theater styles, incorporating fast-paced verses, wordplay, and ensemble raps to bring historical events to life. This approach uses hip-hop to make the story of Alexander Hamilton more dynamic and relatable, showcasing how modern genres can enhance storytelling in performing arts.",

Mrs. Hillary Clinton, who was the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 as well as a fan of the Hamilton musical, told a New York Daily News editorial board meeting she'd \"keep Hamilton where he is.\" Ultimately, thanks to social media, political pressure and legendary hip-hop/rap music, Hamilton stayed on the ten dollar bill. Andrew Jackson, the 7th controversial President who supported slavery and the genocide of millions of Native Americans was removed from the twenty dollar bill. Harriet Tubman, a former slaver and the first women as well as first African-American person to be in charge of a military operation which freed thousands of slaves, now has her picture on the redesigned twenty dollar bill.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        No Appearance\n       \n\n\n\n\n       This character page is on a person who is mentioned in\n       \n        Hamilton\n       \n       , but is not portrayed onstage by a cast member.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       James Alexander Hamilton\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Biographical information\n     \n\n\n       Born\n      \n\n       April 14th, 1788\n      \n\n\n\n       Died\n      \n\n       September 24th, 1878 (aged 90)\n      \n\n\n\n       Gender\n      \n\n       Male\n      \n\n\n\n       Family\n      \n\n\n\n\n          Alexander Hamilton\n         \n         (father)\n        \n\n\n          Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton\n         \n         (mother)\n        \n\n\n          Philip Hamilton\n         \n         (brother)\n        \n\n\n          Angelica Hamilton\n         \n         (sister)\n        \n\n         Alexander Hamilton Jr.\n         (brother)\n        \n\n         John Church Hamilton (brother)\n        \n\n         William S.

    "question": "Who is Alexander Hamilton?",
    "response": "Alexander Hamilton was a key Founding Father of the United States, born around 1755 or 1757 in the British West Indies. He played a pivotal role in the American Revolution, serving as a trusted aide to General George Washington and contributing to military strategies during battles like Yorktown. After the war, he became the first Secretary of the Treasury under President Washington, where he established the nation's financial system, including the creation of a national bank and writing influential essays like the Federalist Papers to support the U.S. Constitution.\n\nOn a personal level, Hamilton faced early hardships—his father left him, and his mother died when he was young. He married Elizabeth Schuyler in 1780, and they had eight children, including sons like Philip and James Alexander Hamilton. His life ended tragically in 1804 at age 47 or 49, after being mortally wounded in a duel with Aaron Burr, a rival politician.\n\nThe musical \"Hamilton,\" inspired by Ron Chernow's biography, portrays him as the dynamic protagonist, highlighting his ambition, intellect, and flaws through songs like \"My Shot\" and \"The Room Where It Happens.\" While the musical creatively dramatizes his story, it's based on real historical events, though it takes some artistic liberties for entertainment.\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into a specific aspect, such as his family, his economic policies, or how the musical adapts his life, what would you like to explore next?",

According to the musical, Hamilton's father left him and his mother, who died from a fever when he was 12. He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else.\n  \n\n   When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr's shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he's cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\"\n   \n    The World Was Wide Enough\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

    "response": "The musical \"Hamilton\" tells the inspiring story of Alexander Hamilton, an ambitious orphan from the Caribbean who rises to become a pivotal figure in American history. It follows his journey from a determined young man fighting in the Revolutionary War as George Washington's right-hand aide, to a war hero, loving husband to Eliza Hamilton, and the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, where he helped establish the nation's economy amid scandals and rivalries. Key characters include George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Aaron Burr, Hamilton's lifelong friend and eventual foe. The show explores historical themes of ambition, legacy, political intrigue, and the founding of the United States, all brought to life through a dynamic blend of hip-hop, R&B, and traditional theater.",

There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr's shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he's cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\"\n   \n    The World Was Wide Enough\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

    "question": "Who is Alexander Hamilton?",
    "response": "Alexander Hamilton was a key Founding Father of the United States, born around 1755 or 1757 in the British West Indies. He played a pivotal role in the American Revolution, serving as a trusted aide to General George Washington and contributing to military strategies during battles like Yorktown. After the war, he became the first Secretary of the Treasury under President Washington, where he established the nation's financial system, including the creation of a national bank and writing influential essays like the Federalist Papers to support the U.S. Constitution.\n\nOn a personal level, Hamilton faced early hardships—his father left him, and his mother died when he was young. He married Elizabeth Schuyler in 1780, and they had eight children, including sons like Philip and James Alexander Hamilton. His life ended tragically in 1804 at age 47 or 49, after being mortally wounded in a duel with Aaron Burr, a rival politician.\n\nThe musical \"Hamilton,\" inspired by Ron Chernow's biography, portrays him as the dynamic protagonist, highlighting his ambition, intellect, and flaws through songs like \"My Shot\" and \"The Room Where It Happens.\" While the musical creatively dramatizes his story, it's based on real historical events, though it takes some artistic liberties for entertainment.\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into a specific aspect, such as his family, his economic policies, or how the musical adapts his life, what would you like to explore next?",

According to the musical, Hamilton's father left him and his mother, who died from a fever when he was 12. He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else.\n  \n\n   When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight.

Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \").

It's inspired by Ron Chernow's biography and blends hip-hop, R&B, and traditional theater music to explore themes like ambition, legacy, the pursuit of the American dream, and the complexities of building a new nation.\n\nMain characters include:\n- **Alexander Hamilton**: The protagonist, a brilliant and driven young man who becomes a military aide to George Washington and helps shape the U.S. financial system.\n- **Aaron Burr**: Hamilton's friend-turned-rival, representing caution and opportunism.\n- **Eliza Hamilton**: Alexander's devoted wife, highlighting themes of love and family.\n- **Angelica Schuyler**: Eliza's sister, who shares a intellectual connection with Hamilton.\n- **George Washington**: A mentor figure, embodying leadership and the burdens of history.\n- Other key figures like Thomas Jefferson and King George III add layers of political conflict and humor.\n\nThe musical's key themes revolve around resilience, the immigrant experience, the cost of ambition, and how ordinary people shape history. It's celebrated for its diverse cast and modern take on historical events, making it both educational and entertaining. If you're thinking about watching it, it's a must-see for its energy and emotional depth—I recommend checking out the original cast recording or a live performance!",

    "question": "Who is Hamilton?",
    "response": "Alexander Hamilton is the titular main protagonist of the musical \"Hamilton,\" which dramatizes the life of the real historical figure, a Founding Father of the United States. Born in the West Indies around 1755 or 1757, he faced early hardships: his father abandoned him, his mother died when he was 12, and a cousin's suicide left him orphaned. A hurricane later devastated his town, leading locals to fund his passage to New York, where he became involved in the American Revolution.\n\nIn the musical's Act One, Hamilton impresses revolutionaries like Aaron Burr with his skills, serves as George Washington's secretary during the war, marries Elizabeth Schuyler, and participates in key battles like Yorktown. In Act Two, he becomes the first Secretary of the Treasury, debates with figures like Thomas Jefferson, and faces personal scandals, including an affair with Maria Reynolds that leads to blackmail and public fallout. His career includes writing the Federalist Papers, clashing with John Adams, and endorsing Jefferson in the 1800 election, but it ends tragically in a duel with Burr, where he is fatally shot.\n\nHamilton's role in history, as portrayed, highlights his contributions to the U.S. financial system, his relentless ambition, and his complex personal life, ultimately shaping his legacy as a brilliant but flawed leader.",

There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \").

However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career.

Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution.

(\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr's shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he's cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\"\n   \n    The World Was Wide Enough\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

    "question": "Who is Hamilton?",
    "response": "Alexander Hamilton is the titular main protagonist of the musical \"Hamilton,\" which dramatizes the life of the real historical figure, a Founding Father of the United States. Born in the West Indies around 1755 or 1757, he faced early hardships: his father abandoned him, his mother died when he was 12, and a cousin's suicide left him orphaned. A hurricane later devastated his town, leading locals to fund his passage to New York, where he became involved in the American Revolution.\n\nIn the musical's Act One, Hamilton impresses revolutionaries like Aaron Burr with his skills, serves as George Washington's secretary during the war, marries Elizabeth Schuyler, and participates in key battles like Yorktown. In Act Two, he becomes the first Secretary of the Treasury, debates with figures like Thomas Jefferson, and faces personal scandals, including an affair with Maria Reynolds that leads to blackmail and public fallout. His career includes writing the Federalist Papers, clashing with John Adams, and endorsing Jefferson in the 1800 election, but it ends tragically in a duel with Burr, where he is fatally shot.\n\nHamilton's role in history, as portrayed, highlights his contributions to the U.S. financial system, his relentless ambition, and his complex personal life, ultimately shaping his legacy as a brilliant but flawed leader.",

According to the musical, Hamilton's father left him and his mother, who died from a fever when he was 12. He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else.\n  \n\n   When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason.

Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself.

According to the musical, Hamilton's father left him and his mother, who died from a fever when he was 12. He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else.\n  \n\n   When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr's shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he's cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\"\n   \n    The World Was Wide Enough\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

    "question": "What was Hamilton accused of in \"We Know?\"",
    "response": "In the song \"We Know\" from the musical Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton is accused by Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Aaron Burr of embezzling government money and committing treason. These accusations stem from suspicious financial transactions that were actually related to Hamilton's extramarital affair with Maria Reynolds, not any actual wrongdoing.",

According to the musical, Hamilton's father left him and his mother, who died from a fever when he was 12. He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else.\n  \n\n   When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr's shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he's cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\"\n   \n    The World Was Wide Enough\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

(\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr's shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he's cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\"\n   \n    The World Was Wide Enough\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

While reading it on vacation in Mexico, Miranda began developing early ideas of a musical revolving Hamilton and his life. He began writing these ideas down, frequently shouting out ideas to his wife, Vanessa Nadal, as they came to mind. After researching, he found that a play by the life of Alexander Hamilton did exist, though it dated back to 1917. The first idea of Hamilton was brought up while Lin was at the bar with Jeremy McCarter. McCarter says \"...Lin-Manuel Miranda told me he wanted to write a hip-hop concept album about the life of Alexander Hamilton. For a second I thought we sharing a drunken joke. We were probably drunk, but he wasn't joking.\"\n  \n\n   Adapted from the biography, Miranda began to draft lyrics and music in his spare time from\n   \n    In The Heights\n   \n   , and created the production\n   \n\n     The Hamilton Mixtape\n    \n\n   , brought to life by the\n   \n    Vassar Workshop\n   \n   (with\n   \n    Alex Lacamoire\n   \n   on the piano). The workshop earned a showcase at New York Stage and Film and gained very positive reviews from famous Broadway personalities. Miranda was later invited to the\n   \n    White House's Evening of Poetry, Music, and the Spoken Word\n   \n   , and, though he was set to perform music from\n   \n    In The Heights\n   \n   , he instead performed the opening number from\n   \n    The Hamilton Mixtape\n   \n   , the to-be version of the first song from the musical titled\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Lincoln Center Performance\n   \n\n\n   A few years after the idea came about, after a few of the songs had been written, Lincoln Center asked him to put on an American Songbook Concert. Tommy Kail suggested they get a band and orchestrate some of the songs to perform at Lincoln Center.\n  \n\n   \"Lin opened the program with a set of songs he called 'the DNA of my brain.' These were [some of the] hits from some of his favorite rappers:.....Then he and his friends performed all of the\n   \n    Hamilton\n   \n   songs that [Lin] had produced so far.\"\n   \n    (Hamilton: The Revolution, Page 46, Paragraph 3)\n   \n\n\n   With increasingly positive comments on the snippet of\n   \n    The Hamilton Mixtape\n   \n   Miranda performed at the White House in the 2009 annual Poetry Jam, and then performed the workshop production of it at the Vassar Reading Festival, which was directed by\n   \n    Thomas Kail\n   \n   , with\n   \n    Alex Lacamoire\n   \n   playing the music.\n  \n\n   From there it reached its Off-Broadway production in The Public Theater, with an entirely different company (excluding\n   \n    Daveed Diggs\n   \n   as\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   /\n   \n    Marquis de Lafayette\n   \n   and\n   \n    Christopher Jackson\n   \n   as George Washington) and after its debut would perform live on Broadway.\n  \n\n   Its schedule to perform from July to September 2018 was:\n   \n    July 9-September 1, 2018: Tuesday @7pm, Wednesday @2pm and 8pm, Thursday @7pm, Friday @8pm, Saturday @2pm and 8pm, and Sunday @3pm\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Songs\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Act I\n     \n\n      Act II\n     \n\n\n\n      1.\n      \n       \"Alexander Hamilton\"\n      \n\n\n      25.\n      \n       \"What'd I Miss?\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      2. \"\n      \n       Aaron Burr, Sir\"\n      \n\n\n      26.\n      \n       \"Cabinet Battle #1\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      3.\n      \n       \"My Shot\"\n      \n\n\n      27.\n      \n       \"Take A Break\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      4.\n      \n       \"The Story of Tonight\"\n      \n\n\n      28.\n      \n       \"Say No To This\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      5.\n      \n       \"The Schuyler Sisters\"\n      \n\n\n      29.\n      \n       \"The Room Where It Happens\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      6.\n      \n       \"Farmer Refuted\"\n      \n\n\n      30.\n      \n       \"Schuyler Defeated\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      7.\n      \n       \"You'll Be Back\"\n      \n\n\n      31.\n      \n       \"Cabinet Battle #2\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      8.\n      \n       \"Right Hand Man\"\n      \n\n\n      32.\n      \n       \"Washington On Your Side\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      9.\n      \n       \"A Winter's Ball\"\n      \n\n\n      33.\n      \n       \"One Last Time\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      10.\n     \n\n      34.\n      \n       \"I Know Him\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      11.\n      \n       \"Satisfied\"\n      \n\n\n      35.\n      \n       \"The Adams Administrations\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      12.\n      \n       \"The Story of Tonight (Reprise)\"\n      \n\n\n      36.\n      \n       \"We Know\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      13.\n      \n       \"Wait For It\"\n      \n\n\n      37.\n      \n       \"Hurricane\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      14.\n      \n       \"Stay Alive\"\n      \n\n\n      38.\n      \n       \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      15.\n      \n       \"Ten Duel Commandments\"\n      \n\n\n      39.\n      \n       \"Burn\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      16.\n      \n       \"Meet Me Inside\"\n      \n\n\n      40.\n      \n       \"Blow Us All Away\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      17.\n      \n       \"That Would Be Enough\"\n      \n\n\n      41.\n      \n       \"Stay Alive (Reprise)\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      18.\n      \n       \"Guns And Ships\"\n      \n\n\n      42.\n      \n       \"It's Quiet Uptown\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      19.\n      \n       \"History Has Its Eyes On You\"\n      \n\n\n      43.\n      \n       \"The Election of 1800\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      20.\n      \n       \"Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\"\n      \n\n\n      44.\n      \n       \"Your Obedient Servant\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      21.\n      \n       \"What Comes Next?\"\n      \n\n\n      45.\n      \n       \"Best of Wives and Best of Women\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      22.\n      \n       \"Dear Theodosia\"\n      \n\n\n      46.\n      \n       \"The World Was Wide Enough\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      23.\n      \n       \"Tomorrow There'll Be More Of Us\"\n      \n\n\n      47.\n      \n       \"Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n      24.\n      \n       \"Non-Stop\"\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Plot summary\n   \n\n\n\n    Act One\n   \n\n\n   The musical begins by introducing the main protagonist\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   and sets his background as coming from a poor family, his father had left and his mother dying when he was 12 years of age. By use of his intelligence and \"top-notch brain\", Alexander travels to New York, in the developing nation of America, in hopes for a better life (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). Upon arrival in the summer of 1776, he immediately seeks out the young upstart\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   for advice, who in turn tells him to \"talk less, smile more\" (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \"). Alexander instead joins up with three revolutionaries:\n   \n    John Laurens\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Marquis de Lafayette\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Hercules Mulligan\n   \n   , and gains their friendship and trust in the Revolution by impressing them with his knowledge and skill (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"), and the four sing about earning their country by staking their lives for the cause (\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \"). As news of the Revolution spreads and grows in excitement, the Schuyler sisters\n   \n    Angelica\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Elizabeth\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Peggy Schuyler\n   \n   sing about their hopes and prospects of the Revolution. (\"\n   \n    The Schuyler Sisters\n   \n   \")\n  \n\n   The opposing Loyalist\n   \n    Samuel Seabury\n   \n   arrives and proclaims against the Revolution, while Hamilton defends the movement by opposing the Loyalist's actions (\"\n   \n    Farmer Refuted\n   \n   \"). A message then arrives from the king of England,\n   \n    King George III\n   \n   , explaining that the king will fight for the colonist's loyalty back (\"\n   \n    You'll Be Back\n   \n   \"). Despite this, Hamilton and his newfound allies go further to join the Continental Army, in which Hamilton is given and accepts a position as\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   's right-hand man (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In the winter ball hosted by\n   \n    Philip Schuyler\n   \n   in 1780, the men are in attendance, and they set their sights on the three Schuyler sisters (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \").\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler\n   \n   , the middle Schuyler sister, immediately fancies Alexander, and after they are introduced by her sister Angelica Schuyler, they are married by the blessing of Eliza's father (\"\n   \"). Angelica, however, still has feelings for Alexander, but keeps them aside for the sake of her sister (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \"). Aaron Burr then meets up with Hamilton, Marquis de Lafayette, John Laurens, and Hercules Mulligan, and privately admits to Hamilton that he is having an affair with the wife of a British officer. Hamilton tells him to go for her (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight (Reprise)\n   \n   \"). However, Burr explains that he will wait for what life has in store for him, like how he has waited for everything else in his past (\"\n   \n    Wait For It\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Revolution is underway, Hamilton continually asks Washington for a promotion and for a command, to which Washington denies. George Washington instead promotes\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   , which leads up to an incredibly disastrous battle, in which Lee is demoted to Marquis de Lafayette. Lee then ",

    "response": "Alexander Hamilton was a pivotal Founding Father whose significance lies in his transformative contributions to the United States' early government and economy, as well as his enduring cultural impact. Historically, he played a key role in the American Revolution as a soldier and aide to George Washington, helped draft the Federalist Papers to support the Constitution, and as the first Secretary of the Treasury, he established the national financial system, including the central bank, which stabilized the economy and promoted manufacturing. His ideas shaped the federal government's structure, emphasizing a strong central authority. Today, his legacy is vividly celebrated through Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical \"Hamilton,\" which has popularized his story, highlighting his immigrant background, ambition, and complexities, inspiring a new generation to appreciate American history's diverse figures.",

According to the musical, Hamilton's father left him and his mother, who died from a fever when he was 12. He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else.\n  \n\n   When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr's shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he's cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\"\n   \n    The World Was Wide Enough\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

    "response": "Alexander Hamilton was a Founding Father of the United States, born around January 11, 1755 or 1757, in the British West Indies. He played a pivotal role in the American Revolution, serving as a key aide to General George Washington and contributing to the victory at the Battle of Yorktown. After the war, he became the first Secretary of the Treasury, where he established the nation's financial system, including the creation of a national bank and promoting economic policies that shaped the early U.S. government.\n\nHamilton's personal life included his marriage to Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton and their eight children, such as Philip and James Alexander Hamilton. His life ended tragically on July 12, 1804, after being mortally wounded in a duel with Aaron Burr.\n\nCulturally, Hamilton's story gained widespread recognition through Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical \"Hamilton,\" inspired by Ron Chernow's biography. The musical highlights his immigrant background, ambition, and contributions, making him a symbol of perseverance and early American history.",

According to the musical, Hamilton's father left him and his mother, who died from a fever when he was 12. He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else.\n  \n\n   When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr's shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he's cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\"\n   \n    The World Was Wide Enough\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else.\n  \n\n   When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr's shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he's cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\"\n   \n    The World Was Wide Enough\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

    "question": "Is Hamilton historically accurate?",
    "response": "Thank you for your question about the historical accuracy of the musical \"Hamilton.\" As a student evaluating this, it's great that you're comparing the musical's portrayals to real historical facts—it's a fantastic way to engage with history through art. I'll provide a balanced overview: while \"Hamilton\" is inspired by real events and people, it's not entirely historically accurate due to its nature as a theatrical production. Here's a breakdown to help you:\n\n### What \"Hamilton\" Gets Right:\n- **Key Historical Figures and Events**: The musical accurately captures major aspects of Alexander Hamilton's life, such as his rise from humble beginnings in the Caribbean, his role as a key figure in the American Revolution, his work as the first Secretary of the Treasury, and his fatal duel with Aaron Burr in 1804. For instance, Hamilton's contributions to the Federalist Papers and his debates with Thomas Jefferson over financial policies are based on real history.\n- **Family and Personal Details**: Elements like Hamilton's marriage to Elizabeth Schuyler and the loss of their son Philip are drawn from historical records, reflecting the emotional toll of these events.\n- **Broader Themes**: The musical highlights themes of immigration, ambition, and the founding of the U.S., which align with Hamilton's historical legacy as an immigrant who shaped the nation's financial system.\n\n### What \"Hamilton\" Gets Wrong or Alters:\n- **Creative Liberties and Anachronisms**: Lin-Manuel Miranda's work is a modern retelling, so it includes hip-hop, rap, and diverse casting to make history relatable, which didn't exist in the 18th century. For example, the musical compresses timelines (e.g., events from years are condensed into scenes) and invents conversations, like the dramatic cabinet battles, which were not verbatim debates.\n- **Character Portrayals**: Some relationships are exaggerated for drama. Aaron Burr is depicted as a complex antagonist, but his real-life motivations were more nuanced. Additionally, the musical downplays or omits certain aspects, such as Hamilton's involvement in slavery (he worked for an abolitionist but also benefited from a slave-owning society), which has been criticized for not being fully addressed.\n- **Inaccuracies in Details**: Not everything is precise—Hamilton's early life is romanticized, and some subplots, like the Reynolds affair, are simplified for the stage.\n\nOverall, \"Hamilton\" is more of an \"inspired by\" story than a documentary. It's highly entertaining and educational for introducing history to new audiences, but it prioritizes emotional and dramatic impact over strict accuracy.\n\nTo verify this independently, I recommend these resources:\n- **Books**: Start with Ron Chernow's biography \"Alexander Hamilton\" (2004), which inspired the musical and provides a detailed, well-researched account.\n- **Online Analyses**: Check out articles from sources like the Smithsonian Magazine or PBS's \"American Experience\" series, which compare the musical to historical facts.\n- **Academic Sources**: Look into JSTOR or university lectures for scholarly papers on historical accuracy in musical theater.\n- **Websites**: The National Archives or Mount Vernon website has primary documents related to Hamilton's era.\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into specific aspects, feel free to ask follow-up questions!",

According to the musical, Hamilton's father left him and his mother, who died from a fever when he was 12. He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else.\n  \n\n   When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \").

According to the musical, Hamilton's father left him and his mother, who died from a fever when he was 12. He then moved in with a cousin who committed suicide, which left him to fend for himself as he had no one else.\n  \n\n   When he became older, a hurricane destroyed his town. In others' time of need, and due to his exceedingly brilliant intelligence, the citizens of the town collected funds so that Hamilton could book passage on a New York-bound ship (\"\n   \n    Alexander Hamilton\n   \n   \"). When Hamilton arrived in New York he became interested in the up-and-coming American revolution. There he first meets\n   \n    Aaron Burr\n   \n   in New York City (\"\n   \n    Aaron Burr, Sir\n   \n   \") and is then introduced to the rest of Burr's revolutionary friends and impresses them with his oratory skills (\"\n   \n    My Shot\n   \n   \"). He has long dreamed of laying down his life for a cause such as the revolution (\"\n   \n    The Story of Tonight\n   \n   \") and studied furiously before joining the Revolution, and becoming George Washington's secretary during the war. (\"\n   \n    Right Hand Man\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton then attends a winter ball (\"\n   \n    A Winter's Ball\n   \n   \"), where he meets\n   \n    Elizabeth Schuyler.\n   \n   They talk to each other through letters for two weeks and eventually marry (\"\n   \"). Her sister also had feelings for him, but Angelica allows Eliza to marry Hamilton, because she 'loves her sister more than anything in this life'. (\"\n   \n    Satisfied\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   General\n   \n    George Washington\n   \n   sends Hamilton home during the war for disobeying direct orders and engaging in a duel with General\n   \n    Charles Lee\n   \n   (\"\n   \n    Meet Me Inside\n   \n   \"). However, soon after he was summoned back, (\"\n   \n    Guns And Ships\n   \n   \") to finish the war at the Battle of Yorktown. (\"\n   \n    Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After the war, Eliza gives birth to a baby boy named\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , whose innocent brilliance leaves him astounded (\"\n   \n    Dear Theodosia\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton returns to New York to finish his studies and pursue a law career. Hamilton is then chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Hamilton enlists\n   \n    James Madison\n   \n   and John Jay to write The Federalist Papers after Aaron Burr refuses. The newly elected President Washington enlists Hamilton for the job of Secretary of Treasury, despite Eliza's pleas. (\"\n   \n    Non-Stop\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n\n    Act Two\n   \n\n\n   After\n   \n    Thomas Jefferson\n   \n   returns from France in 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate over the merits of Hamilton's financial plan during a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress. (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #1\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton's son turns nine, and he corresponds with Angelica in England, where she advises him to sway Jefferson so that Congress accepts his plan. Angelica travels back to New York to go upstate with his family but he refuses insisting he has to work. (\"\n   \n    Take A Break\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   While alone,\n   \n    Maria Reynolds\n   \n   visits Hamilton, who seduces him by claiming that her husband mistreats her. They continue to have an affair for a month until Maria's husband\n   \n    James Reynolds\n   \n   blackmails Hamilton into paying him money. In return, Reynolds will not tell Eliza about the affair. Hamilton agrees to pay Reynolds and continues the affair. (\"\n   \n    Say No To This\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Hamilton discusses his plan with Jefferson and Madison over a private dinner, which results in the Compromise of 1790, giving support to Hamilton's financial plan in exchange for moving the United States capital from New York to Washington, D.C., a site that is much closer to Jefferson's home in Virginia (\"\n   \n    The Room Where It Happens\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   In another cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in their revolution. Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument of neutrality (\"\n   \n    Cabinet Battle #2\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As Washington steps down from his presidential position, Hamilton drafts his farewell address. (\"\n   \n    One Last Time\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Now having no political office since the election of John Adams, Hamilton is outraged by Adams's \"unprepared\" nature according to Hamilton. They get in a fight with Adams bashing Hamilton for being an orphan; Hamilton's response being very harsh to Adams's weight. Hamilton's reputation takes a blow from this, and his political enemies, Burr, Jefferson, and Madison, think that it is the perfect time to destroy him (\"\n   \n    The Adams Administration\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Thinking they have discovered a scandal capable of destroying Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Burr accuse him of embezzling government money and committing treason. In reality, however, they found the transactions from his affair with Maria Reynolds. Hamilton, knowing that the truth is the only way out, tells them about his affair and begs them not to tell anyone (\"\n   \n    We Know\n   \n   \"). Still worried that they would, Hamilton thinks about how writing openly and honestly has saved him in the past (\"\n   \n    Hurricane\n   \n   \"), and publicly writes \"The Reynolds Pamphlet\" to come clean about the affair, hoping to save his political legacy (\"\n   \n    The Reynolds Pamphlet\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   After his eldest child,\n   \n    Philip Hamilton\n   \n   , challenges\n   \n    George Eacker\n   \n   to a\n   \n    duel\n   \n   , he is mortally wounded and dies from infection (\"\n   \n    Blow Us All Away\n   \n   \"). Hamilton and Eliza become increasingly depressed after their loss and they move uptown (\"\n   \n    It's Quiet Uptown\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   As the Election of 1800 approaches, Alexander Hamilton is frequently asked about who he will promote for president. Shockingly, Hamilton selects Jefferson, claiming that Burr has no beliefs and stands for himself. (\"\n   \n    The Election of 1800\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   Burr, angry at his absent endorsement, challenges Hamilton to a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey (\"\n   \n    Your Obedient Servant\n   \n   \"). As a gunshot sounds, Hamilton soliloquizes on death, his relationships, and his legacy. He aims his pistol at the sky and is struck by Burr's shot, dying soon after. Burr laments that even though he survived, he's cursed to be the villain in history, remembered only as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton (\"\n   \n    The World Was Wide Enough\n   \n   \").\n  \n\n   He now lies in Trinity Church, right near Angelica after she passed away.

He is first introduced as a main character in Baum's first Oz book titled\n   \n\n     The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\n    \n\n   , published in 1900. He makes his debut appearance in the fifth chapter of the novel titled\n   \n    The Rescue of the Tin Woodman\n   \n   . He was born and raised in the magical\n   \n    Land of Oz\n   \n   and his real given birth name is Nicholas Chopper, or simply \"Nick\" Chopper for short. However, he is more known and called by his popular nickname, the Tin Woodman or just \"Tin-Man\" for short. He also is the second comrade to join the story's child protagonist and heroine of the novel named\n   \n    Dorothy Gale\n   \n   , who finds him rusted solid in distress in the middle of a forest.

Nick Chopper was once a great and strong man who worked happily as a humble woodsman before being tragically turned slowly into his current form of tin, having his \"meat\" body replaced by a metal one with no internal organs, heart, brain, lungs etc. This makes him different from other beings like\n   Tik-Tok\n   --the mechanical copper man from Oz's\n   \n    Royal Army of Oz\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Baums' Description\n   \n\n\n   Unlike Tik-Tok who strictly runs on clockwork, having to be wound up to function, and said to love no more than a sewing machine, the Tin Woodman still has a soul, a spirit, a life-force compared to other mechanical things in Oz that are made of metals as well. This explains why he still desperately craved for a loving heart because he wanted a significant other just like he did as a man of flesh and blood. Other beings in Oz such as\n   Jack Pumpkinhead\n   and the\n   Patchwork Girl\n   were both brought to life with magic spells or potions, such as the\n   Powder of Life\n   , therefore they do not miss having a heart as they never had one to begin with. Unlike the Tin Woodman these figures were not once living and breathing beings who's souls transferred to their current form. Yet despite this, the Tin Woodman is far from missing his original existence. The Tin Woodman is now very proud (perhaps too proud) of his untiring tin body as he is so unique out of any one else in Oz, there are plenty of lions and scarecrows throughout the land but there is only one Nick Chopper.\n  \n\n   The Tin Woodman always carries his handy chopping axe everywhere he goes and is never seen without it. His axe is apart of him and his identity, being his trademark piece. If he ever lost his axe or had his axe taken from him, he would most likely become lost as well and unable to properly function without it. However, he has no need for food or drink or even sleep, but he was prone to rust before he was nickel-plated. With or without a heart, he was always the most sensitive, tender, and emotional of\n   \n    Dorothy's\n   \n   companions (just as the\n   \n    Scarecrow\n   \n   was the wisest and the\n   \n    Cowardly Lion\n   \n   the bravest). When he accidentally crushed an insect while walking on the\n   \n    Yellow Brick Road\n   \n   to see the great\n   \n    Wizard\n   \n   , he was grief-stricken and, ironically, claimed that he must be careful about such things from then on out, while those with hearts do not need such care.\n   \n    (\n    \n     The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\n    \n    )\n   \n\n\n   His appreciation of his heart notably contrasts with the Scarecrow's pride in his brains, reflecting a common debate between the relative importance of the mind and the emotions. This, indeed, occasions philosophical debate between the two friends as to why each one's choices are superior. Neither convinces the other, but they remain the closest of friends.\n  \n\n   The Tin Woodman is so well-loved that the \"\n   Shining Emperor Waltz\n   \" was written in his honor by Mr. H.M.\n   \n    Wogglebug\n   \n   , T.E. When the Wogglebug later asked about his genealogy, he claimed, \"I am a Tin Woodman and you may enter me in your book under the name of Smith, for a\n   tin smith\n   made me, and as Royal Emperor of the\n   \n    Winkies\n   \n   , I do not care to go back to my meat connections.\"\n  \n\n\n    Oz History: Nick Chopper the Helpless Romantic...\n   \n\n\n\n    An independent 2010 film by\n    \n     Whitestone Movie Pictures\n    \n    , that is available online, specifically on YouTube, titled:\n    \n     \"HEARTLESS: The story of the Tin Man\n    \n    \", was made for Oz fans alike.

He makes his debut appearance in the fifth chapter of the novel titled\n   \n    The Rescue of the Tin Woodman\n   \n   . He was born and raised in the magical\n   \n    Land of Oz\n   \n   and his real given birth name is Nicholas Chopper, or simply \"Nick\" Chopper for short. However, he is more known and called by his popular nickname, the Tin Woodman or just \"Tin-Man\" for short. He also is the second comrade to join the story's child protagonist and heroine of the novel named\n   \n    Dorothy Gale\n   \n   , who finds him rusted solid in distress in the middle of a forest.

He is first introduced as a main character in Baum's first Oz book titled\n   \n\n     The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\n    \n\n   , published in 1900. He makes his debut appearance in the fifth chapter of the novel titled\n   \n    The Rescue of the Tin Woodman\n   \n   . He was born and raised in the magical\n   \n    Land of Oz\n   \n   and his real given birth name is Nicholas Chopper, or simply \"Nick\" Chopper for short. However, he is more known and called by his popular nickname, the Tin Woodman or just \"Tin-Man\" for short. He also is the second comrade to join the story's child protagonist and heroine of the novel named\n   \n    Dorothy Gale\n   \n   , who finds him rusted solid in distress in the middle of a forest. In the end of the story, the Tin Woodman earns what he so deeply desired for, and in Baum's  \nsubsequent\n   \n    Oz books\n   \n   ; he becomes one of the most loving and compassionate figures in all of Oz.\n  \n\n\n    In the book, it is stated by Baum he was born in the eastern quadrant in Oz known as\n    \n     Munchkin Country\n    \n    even though he is of average adult height. This hints he might not be a full blooded Munchkinlander since 90% of the\n    \n     Munchkin\n    \n    people are all small, standing only three to four feet high. However, not all Munchkins are described as being short in the Oz books.\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n\n        A Man Made Out of Tin\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Baums' Description\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Oz History: Nick Chopper the Helpless Romantic...\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       The Wonderful Wizard of Oz-1900\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       After The Wizard\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Book Appearances\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       Background Information\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Modern fiction\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n       Depictions on Stage and Screen\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.1\n        \n\n         Silent Film\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.2\n        \n\n         1939 Movie\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.3\n        \n\n         The Wiz (1974-1978)\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.4\n        \n\n         Return to Oz 1985\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           9.4.1\n          \n\n           The Wizard of Oz In Concert: Dreams Come True\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         9.5\n        \n\n         The Muppets' Wizard of Oz 2005\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.6\n        \n\n         Beef Ravioli Commercials\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.7\n        \n\n         Syfy's Tinman 2007\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.8\n        \n\n         Dorothy and the Witches of Oz 2011\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.9\n        \n\n         Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return 2014\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.10\n        \n\n         Jim Shore\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.11\n        \n\n         The Wiz Live!\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       10\n      \n\n       In Video Games\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         10.1\n        \n\n         Emerald City Confidential\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       11\n      \n\n       Oz Gallery\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       12\n      \n\n       Credits\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       13\n      \n\n       References to the Tin Woodman in popular culture\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       14\n      \n\n       Sources of the Tin Woodman image\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       15\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     A Man Made Out of Tin\n    \n\n\n\n\n    The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\n   \n   (1900)\n  \n\n   The Tin Woodman of Oz is made entirely of shiny hallow silver tin, and cleverly jointed together, although he rattles and clanks a little as he moves, he is able to bend his joints and get around quiet easily when properly lubricated. Nick Chopper was once a great and strong man who worked happily as a humble woodsman before being tragically turned slowly into his current form of tin, having his \"meat\" body replaced by a metal one with no internal organs, heart, brain, lungs etc. This makes him different from other beings like\n   \n    Tik-Tok\n   \n   --the mechanical copper man from Oz's\n   \n    Royal Army of Oz\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Baums' Description\n   \n\n\n   Unlike Tik-Tok who strictly runs on clockwork, having to be wound up to function, and said to love no more than a sewing machine, the Tin Woodman still has a soul, a spirit, a life-force compared to other mechanical things in Oz that are made of metals as well. This explains why he still desperately craved for a loving heart because he wanted a significant other just like he did as a man of flesh and blood. Other beings in Oz such as\n   \n    Jack Pumpkinhead\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Patchwork Girl\n   \n   were both brought to life with magic spells or potions, such as the\n   \n    Powder of Life\n   \n   , therefore they do not miss having a heart as they never had one to begin with. Unlike the Tin Woodman these figures were not once living and breathing beings who's souls transferred to their current form. Yet despite this, the Tin Woodman is far from missing his original existence. The Tin Woodman is now very proud (perhaps too proud) of his untiring tin body as he is so unique out of any one else in Oz, there are plenty of lions and scarecrows throughout the land but there is only one Nick Chopper.\n  \n\n   The Tin Woodman always carries his handy chopping axe everywhere he goes and is never seen without it. His axe is apart of him and his identity, being his trademark piece. If he ever lost his axe or had his axe taken from him, he would most likely become lost as well and unable to properly function without it. However, he has no need for food or drink or even sleep, but he was prone to rust before he was nickel-plated. With or without a heart, he was always the most sensitive, tender, and emotional of\n   \n    Dorothy's\n   \n   companions (just as the\n   \n    Scarecrow\n   \n   was the wisest and the\n   \n    Cowardly Lion\n   \n   the bravest). When he accidentally crushed an insect while walking on the\n   \n    Yellow Brick Road\n   \n   to see the great\n   \n    Wizard\n   \n   , he was grief-stricken and, ironically, claimed that he must be careful about such things from then on out, while those with hearts do not need such care.\n   \n    (\n    \n     The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\n    \n    )\n   \n\n\n   His appreciation of his heart notably contrasts with the Scarecrow's pride in his brains, reflecting a common debate between the relative importance of the mind and the emotions. This, indeed, occasions philosophical debate between the two friends as to why each one's choices are superior. Neither convinces the other, but they remain the closest of friends.\n  \n\n   The Tin Woodman is so well-loved that the \"\n   Shining Emperor Waltz\n   \" was written in his honor by Mr. H.M.\n   \n    Wogglebug\n   \n   , T.E. When the Wogglebug later asked about his genealogy, he claimed, \"I am a Tin Woodman and you may enter me in your book under the name of Smith, for a\n   tin smith\n   made me, and as Royal Emperor of the\n   \n    Winkies\n   \n   , I do not care to go back to my meat connections.\"\n  \n\n\n    Oz History: Nick Chopper the Helpless Romantic...\n   \n\n\n\n    An independent 2010 film by\n    \n     Whitestone Movie Pictures\n    \n    , that is available online, specifically on YouTube, titled:\n    \n     \"HEARTLESS: The story of the Tin Man\n    \n    \", was made for Oz fans alike.

Frank Baum\n   \n   . It was Baum's first novel for an adult readership. The book was released under the pseudonym \"Schuyler Staunton.\" Baum arrived at that name by adding one letter to the name of his late maternal uncle, Schuyler Stanton.\n  \n\n   The novel was serialized in\n   \n    The Philadelphia North American\n   \n   in 1905, under the alternative title\n   \n    The Emperor's Spy\n   \n   , prior to its book publication.\n  \n\n\n    Summary\n   \n\n\n   Robert Harcliffe, a recent college graduate, works for his Uncle Nelson in the family's mercantile business in New Orleans. Nelson Harcliffe receives a letter from an old client in Brazil, Dom Miguel de Pintra, who is a wealthy man who has retired from business to devote himself to politics — specifically to the republican cause that hopes to end the Brazilian Empire. Dom Miguel has written to request a secretary; Robert, eager for adventure, takes the job.\n  \n\n   Robert's attitude is devil-may-care at first, yet he quickly learns that he has entered into a dangerous enterprise. He cleverly evades a murderous spy on the voyage down to Rio de Janeiro; but as soon as he reaches the city he is arrested by the police. In the carriage taking him to the police station, the lieutenant in charge is murdered by his own sergeant, who is a republican sympathizer. The sergeant and other sympathizers guide Harcliffe to Dom Miguel's plantation in Matto Grosso state.\n  \n\n   There, Harcliffe becomes a devoted admirer of de Pintra and a republican sympathizer himself. (Baum presents this as an American's natural preference, over the archaic, authoritarian, European imperial system.)  Robert also learns that the circle around Dom Miguel is fraught with uncertainty. The man's daughter Izabel is cold and hostile, while his ward Lesba is an ardent republican and a beauty with whom Harcliffe soon falls in love. Lesba's brother appears to be a republican too — yet he serves as the Emperor's Minister of Police. Harcliffe wrestles with the question of who can be trusted, and who is playing a \"double game.\"\n  \n\n   The mystery aspects of the plot center on a massive steel vault, impregnated with nitro glycerin, that is hidden in a sub-basement of de Pintra's mansion. It holds the treasury and the incriminating records of the republican movement; it opens with an exotic key, a specially-cut emerald in Dom Miguel's ring. The ring is stolen, which leads Harcliffe on a challenging and puzzling chase.\n  \n\n   As the revolution starts, Dom Miguel, Harcliffe, and other supporters are captured and face a firing squad, only to be rescued (some of them at least) at the last minute, by Lesba and a troop of rebels. When the rebellion succeeds, Harcliffe marries Lesba and becomes the director of commerce in the new regime. The couple raise their children in a cosmopolitan style, spending the southern-hemisphere summer in New Orleans and the rest of the year in Brazil.\n  \n\n\n    Background\n   \n\n\n   Baum employed real figures of contemporary history and current event in his book — Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca, Floriano Peixoto, and even Emperor Pedro II.\n  \n\n   The book was successful enough to justify a follow-up effort: a second Schuyler Staunton novel,\n   \n\n     Daughters of Destiny\n    \n\n   , was issued in 1906.\n  \n\n\n    The Fate of a Crown\n   \n   was reprinted in a paperback edition in 2008.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Aunt Jane's Nieces at Millville\n     \n\n\n\n      Author\n     \n\n\n       L.

These efforts do not always yield financially sound results. In one case, Merrick and Doyle loaned a few thousand dollars to a young inventor named Joseph Wegg for a patent he was developing — but Wegg lost a patent lawsuit, and Merrick now owns the collateral on the loan, a farm in a remote region of upper New York State. In his capricious way, Uncle John decides to take his nieces to the farm to escape the city's heat in the approaching summer. He arranges for a real-estate agent to get the farmhouse in good order and ships crates of furnishings to the place, sight unseen.\n  \n\n   Merrick and the girls come north, and find the farmhouse a surprisingly appealing place. The local inhabitants of a tiny village in the Adirondack mountains are naturally interested in the new residents; they call Merrick \"the nabob.\" The cousins quickly become interested in the family of the previous owner. Joe Wegg's father had been a retired sea captain, and something of a recluse; his close friend Will Thompson went mad when Captain Wegg died, and both their fortunes mysteriously disappeared. The girls meet and become friends with Thompson's daughter Ethel, the local schoolteacher. Also, the cousins (with Louise in the lead; she takes a more prominent role in this book than in the previous volumes) decide that Captain Wegg was murdered and robbed, and they set out in search of suspects.\n  \n\n   They pry into the local past, with limited success. Matters begin to clear when Joe Wegg returns home to convalesce after a car accident. The girls are dispirited to learn that there was no murder and no robbery. It is Uncle John who unravels a genuine mystery, as to the fate of the Wegg and Thompson fortunes.

Yet Baum's view of urban and rural manners does not lean wholly one way. Baum approvingly contrasts the relative moral innocence and \"simplicity\" of the country with the \"guile\" of the city; and the three cousins are praised for being \"so simple\" without being \"cityfied\" or \"stuck up.\"\n  \n\n   The\n   \n    Aunt Jane's Nieces\n   \n   books have been studied for the light they cast on the \"Progressive dilemma\" of adapting \"rural values to a complex urban society.\"\n  \n\n\n    Commonalities\n   \n\n\n   Elements from other Baum books, and also from his biography, turn up in\n   \n    Aunt Jane's Nieces at Millville\n   \n   .

It is the seventh in the ten volumes in the\n   \n    Aunt Jane's Nieces\n   \n   series, and carries forward the continuing story of the three cousins\n   Lousie Merrick Weldon\n   ,\n   Patsy Doyle\n   , and\n   Elizabeth De Graf\n   . Like all the books in the series, it was issued under Baum's \"Edith Van Dyne\" pseudonym.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Setting\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Summary\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Background\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         The news business\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         The duel\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Amnesia\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Setting\n   \n\n\n   The novel returns to Millville, the setting for the series' third installment,\n   \n    Aunt Jane's Nieces at Millville\n   \n   . Supporting and minor characters from that earlier book recur in this seventh volume.\n  \n\n   Temporally, the seventh novel occurs in the following summer, after the third. A strict consistency would demand that the events of the intervening three books all occur in the winter between those two summers — but Baum is not terribly concerned with such consistency. Time is more condensed as well as more flexible in the fictional world of the cousins.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n    Aunt Jane's Nieces on Vacation\n   \n   , three years have elapsed since the start of the series. Louise is seventeen years old in the first book, and twenty in the seventh, though six years of real time have passed between the volumes. Curiously, Baum makes the other cousins younger than they should be in a  strict chronology: in the first book, Patsy is about a year younger than Louise, but here in\n   \n    on Vacation\n   \n   she is \"more than two years the junior....\"\n  \n\n   Baum no doubt kept Patsy and Beth young so that the books' readers would find it easier to maintain a sympathy with them. (Characters in popular television shows and comic strips are impervious to normal aging in the same way.)\n  \n\n\n    Summary\n   \n\n\n   Uncle John\n   and his nieces travel to Millville on their private railroad car. They are accompanied by Louise's new husband\n   Arthur Weldon\n   , and unwittingly by an amiable hobo who hitches a ride on the outside of their carriage. Once ensconced at their farmhouse, Uncle John opines that the only comfort missing is a morning paper. In the discussion that follows, the girls decide to start their own local newspaper. Arthur Weldon is amazed when their uncle supports their unrealistic plan; Uncle John calls his New York banker and orders a complete printing plant, with all necessities, to be sent to them. The girls appoint themselves editors, with Patsy in charge overall; Uncle John hires typesetters and a pressman and other staff, including the amiable hobo, who calls himself Thursday Smith, and a young but veteran newspaper sketch artist named Hetty Hewitt. Soon their\n   \n    Millville Tribune\n   \n   issues its first edition.\n  \n\n   The girl journalists report on the small-town doings of the local residents. They run into problems with a corrupt local politician, and also with the manager of a nearby sawmill and his rowdy workers. The workers riot in town and even try to blow up the newspaper office. The girls persevere, however, and maintain their paper through the summer. When the season ends and they return to new York City, they pass their paper to Thursday Smith and Hetty Hewitt, who marry and continue the\n   \n    Tribune\n   \n   as a family enterprise.\n  \n\n\n    Background\n   \n\n\n\n    The news business\n   \n\n\n   Baum drew heavily upon his knowledge and experience in the news business, earned in his years with\n   \n    The Aberdeen Pioneer\n   \n   . Yet he never pretends that the girls' newspaper is a practical enterprise. Arthur Weldon calculates that in its second month in business, the\n   \n    Millville Tribune\n   \n   lost 88 cents on every copy of the penny paper sold.\n  \n\n   When Weldon questions Uncle John on his willingness to finance the girls' \"plaything,\" this \"incomprehensible eccentricity,\" Merrick explains his motives. He eventually plans to make the three girls the heirs to his fortune: each will someday command millions of dollars. \"I'm educating my girls to be energetic and self-reliant,\" he says at one point; and the newspaper is one teaching tool in practical affairs and worldly work.\n  \n\n   When the cousins relinquish their paper, it shifts from a daily to a weekly periodical, which gives it at least some hope of financial viability.\n  \n\n\n    The duel\n   \n\n\n   The novel delivers  a version of the duel story that surfaces elsewhere in Baum lore. In this story, Louise reports on Molly Sizer's birthday party, but her report contains an unfortunate typographical error: what Louise called Molly's \"roguish smile\" is printed as her \"roughish smile.\" For revenge, Molly's thuggish brother Bill wants to horsewhip Arthur Weldon, whom the girls have listed first on the paper's masthead (though he has almost no connection with the paper). The local justice of the peace interferes, and structures the confrontation as an old-fashioned duel: Sizer runs away, and Weldon is left the apparent victor.\n  \n\n\n    Amnesia\n   \n\n\n   Thursday Smith suffers from amnesia in this book, just as Lucy Rogers does in\n   \n    Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work\n   \n   . Baum pictures amnesia not only as wiping out the sufferer's past experience, but also restoring him to a state of moral and ethical innocence — the same way the\n   Water of Oblivion\n   functions in the\n   \n    Oz books\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

They were truly a loyal yet carefree bunch who mostly kept to themselves and stuck with their own kind. They had a King, who was the ruler of the clan, and he was their leader who was the largest and most strongest Monkey of them all. But the Monkeys were also rather mischievous by nature, always looking to get into some innocent fun. However, one fateful day in Oz the King of the Winged Monkeys, decided as a prank, to toss a very richly dressed man into a raging river, soaking him from head to toe and completely ruining his handsome costume of soft golden silk and velvet.\n  \n\n   The man, whose name was\n   \n    Quelala\n   \n   , was good natured enough and did not mind the prank and thought it to be rather funny. But his fiancée named\n   \n    Gayelette\n   \n   , was distraught and ever so furious. Gayelette was a beautiful princess and the ruler of the Northern\n   \n    Gillikin Country\n   \n   and lived in a small jeweled palace.\n  \n\n   Gayelette was angry at the Winged Monkeys because the day they chose to play the prank on Quelala, was the same day of his and Gayellette's royal wedding. And what the Winged Monkeys did not know, was that Gayellette also happened to be a great sorceress who practiced magic. And she was so upset for all the unwanted monkey business, she punished the King Monkey and his entire group of winged creatures forever, cursing them all by making them the eternal slaves to whoever wore the\n   \n    Golden Cap\n   \n   upon their head. And whoever wore it could command them to do any deed they wished three times.\n  \n\n   Now, Gayellete originally had this cap prepared as a valuable and authentic wedding present for her beloved betrothed. And the cap itself was a beautiful one indeed, being made out of real solid gold and adorned with real diamonds and rubies that ran all around the 24 karat gold brim. It is rumored that this cap alone cost princess Gayellette half of her kingdom and sorcery to construct.\n  \n\n   When finally given the cap to wear after the wedding, Quelala then used It's powerful charm only once and once only, commanding the Winged Monkeys to stay far away from Gayelette, in fear that his new wife might punish the Winged Monkeys even more severely due to her short temper. So, as the years went by, they did as they were told and never came too close to Gayelette's Gillikin kingdom or her subjects ever again. After this, the band disappeared for a long time.\n  \n\n   But the magic chant of the Golden Cap was set, and had even been engraved on the inside of the cap. The incantation of the charm that called the Winged Monkeys was:\n  \n\n\n    First, stand upon the left foot and say\n    \n\n      \"Ep-pe, Pep-pe, Kak-ke.\"\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n    Then, stand upon the right foot and say\n    \n\n      \"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo.\"\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n    Finally, stand on both feet and shout\n    \n\n      \"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\"\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Whenever those words were properly spoken out loud, the Winged Monkeys stopped what they were doing, abandoned their work or play at once and immediately came to assist their temporary master.\n  \n\n\n    In\n    \n     The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\n    \n    1900:\n   \n\n\n   As time went on--many centuries later the magic cap fell into the hands of the\n   \n    Wicked Witch of the West\n   \n   , who was already a powerful figure in the western qaudrant in Oz known as the\n   \n    Winkie Country\n   \n   . She wickedly used her first wish with the Winged Monkeys to help her conquer all of the west lands and enslave the majority of the native people who lived in the west called\n   \n    Winkies\n   \n   . Her second wish was to defeat the\n   \n    Great Oz\n   \n   , by having the Winged Monkeys run the man out of her territory when he dared to challenge her. So, as revenge the Wizard eventually sent a lost little girl named\n   \n    Dorothy Gale\n   \n   to kill her in exchange for being sent back home to\n   \n    Kansas\n   \n   after being taken to Oz unexpectedly by a\n   \n    cyclone\n   \n   . But the Wicked Witch used the magic cap for the last time and had the Winged Monkeys capture the girl, her dog named\n   \n    Toto\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Cowardly Lion\n   \n   to imprison them in her castle as her personal servants.\n  \n\n   She also had the Monkeys destroy the\n   \n    Scarecrow\n   \n   and\n   \n    Tin Woodman\n   \n   who had also accompanied them.\n  \n\n   After the Wicked Witch was ultimately killed by being liquefied and melted away by Dorothy after she tried to steal one of the girl's magic\n   \n    Silver Shoes\n   \n   , the Winkies were set free from the Witch's wrath and to thank Dorothy, they restored the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman. Dorothy then took the cap as her own to wear and eventually used it too.\n  \n\n   The first time, Dorothy commanded the Winged Monkeys to carry her and her companions back to the\n   \n    Emerald City\n   \n   . After the Wizard was discovered to be a humbug, Dorothy used the cap to ask them to carry her and Toto home to Kansas instead, but to the girls dismay they could not because the creatures were forbidden by the laws of the universe to travel beyond the magical realm of Oz. Thus, resulting in Dorothy wasting one request and command of the cap's magic charm. Afterwards, Dorothy made her third and final request. Which was for the Monkeys to safley carry her and her friends over the very rocky hill of the unfriendly creatures known as\n   \n    Hammer-Heads\n   \n   while on her journey to the\n   \n    Quadling Country\n   \n   to see the beautiful Good Witch named\n   \n    Glinda\n   \n   , who was her last hope and resort to find a way home.\n  \n\n   Before leaving Oz, Dorothy finally gave the cap to Glinda, who in exchange let Dorothy in on the secret charm of the Silver Shoes she was wearing which would take her and her dog home again. Glinda then ordered the Monkeys to carry Dorothy's companions back to their new homes in Oz after Dorothy's departure and then to cease to bother people. Glinda then gave the winged creatures the cap as their own, to free them forever, ending the curse of Gayellette. After that the Winged Monkeys disappeared to live a life of freedom and peace somewhere within Oz as they had once did many centuries prior. And the Winged Monkeys learned a very valuable lesson, to never play pranks on anyone ever again.\n  \n\n\n    The Wizard of Oz-Fly, Fly, Fly! (1939)\n   \n\n\n   '\n  \n\n   The monkeys in the classic Judy Garland film, are purple monkeys, with purple wings that wear elaborate caps and matching vests. They are simply the creatures of the\n   \n    Wicked Witch of the West\n   \n   . The monkey leader is named\n   \n    Nikko\n   \n   . They do not speak, or act independently of the Witch's will.\n  \n\n   The Golden Cap can be seen, making a cameo appearance in the Witch's castle chamber, but she does not wear it nor say it's charm. The Witch sends the monkeys out to apprehend\n   \n    Dorothy Gale\n   \n   and her companions, but they only get Dorothy and Toto and scatter the Scarecrow's straw. They disappear from the story after the Witch has been melted. Most likely just like the Winkie gaurds, they were all finally set free from her bondage after she d \n\n\n\n\n\n    *\n    \n     The Golden Cap of Oz: 1-2-3\n    \n    *\n   \n\n\n   The\n   \n    Golden Cap\n   \n   is a magical item that is introduced in\n   \n    L. Frank Baum\n   \n   's first Oz book titled\n   \n\n     The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\n    \n\n   , published in 1900. The cap itself is magically and enchanted with an authentic special charm that allows who ever wears it on their head to call upon the Ozian creatures called\n   \n    Winged Monkeys\n   \n   , (aka Flying Monkeys) three times and three times only. Much like rubbing a magic lamp to get three wishes from a Genie.\n  \n\n\n    Baums' Description\n   \n\n\n   The Golden Cap is a strange and unique-looking hat made of soft yellow velvet and fine golden silk, with a beautiful brim of solid gold that circled around the entire cap to make it sturdy and wearable. On this brim was a circle of sparkling diamonds and red rubies.\n  \n\n   The enchantment held within it is a special charm that is only invoked by the following incantation, which is written inside the cap that one must shout out loud for it to properly work.\n  \n\n\n\n     The Charm Of The Golden Cap:\n    \n\n\n\n   While saying the magic spell of the cap one must also follow the movements the words require which are the following:\n  \n\n\n    First, stand upon the left foot and say: \"\n    \n\n      EP-PE, PEP-PE, KAK-KE \"\n     \n\n\n\n    Then, stand upon the right foot and say: \"\n    \n\n      HIL-LO, HOL-LO, HEL-LO\n     \n\n    \"\n   \n\n    Finally, stand on both feet and shout: \"\n    \n\n      ZIZ-ZY, ZUZ-ZY, ZIK!!! \"\n     \n\n\n\n\n   After doing this correctly, the Winged Monkeys in Oz appear before you and at your service. They must obey you no matter how good or bad the desired deed you want done by them may be.\n  \n\n\n    Oz History: Princess Gayelette & The Golden Cap...\n   \n\n\n   Many centuries ago in the magical\n   \n    Land of Oz\n   \n   , the Golden Cap was first intended to be a valuable wedding present from a beautiful and fair princess of Oz named\n   \n    Gayelette\n   \n   who ruled over the Northern\n   \n    Gillikin Country\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   This gift was to be for her dearly beloved\n   \n    Quelala\n   \n   , and was said to have cost half her royal Kingdom to create. One fateful day, the group of Winged Monkeys who were mischievous troublemakers, loving to play and horse around, played a trick on Quelala only all in innocent fun by dropping him in a river and getting him  soaking wet on Princess Gayelette's wedding day. Now Gayelette wasn't just any average pretty princess, she also was also a great Sorceress who was talented in practicing the magic arts of Witchcraft. When she found out what the Monkeys did to her soon to be husband on her big day, she became infuriated and punished them by making them eternal slaves to the Golden Cap that was meant to be a gift for Quelala who happened to be the first owner of the Golden Cap. He then commanded the Winged Monkeys to stay away from Gayelette and the royal kingdom they lived in so they would not upset Gayelette ever again. The Monkeys were all banished from the place Gayelette ruled over and were never allowed to come back.\n  \n\n   Many centuries later, the Golden Cap unfortunately fell into the hands of the\n   \n    Wicked Witch of the West\n   \n   , who used it first to conquer the western quadrant known as the\n   \n    Winkie Country\n   \n   of Oz and enslaved the native Ozians called\n   \n    Winkies\n   \n   to work for her night and day.\n  \n\n   Then she used it a second time to fight off the\n   \n    Wizard\n   \n   who arrived in Oz via hot air-balloon and tried to conquer her and steal her land. And finally the last time she used it, she ordered the Winged Monkeys to capture\n   \n    Dorothy Gale\n   \n   , her dog\n   \n    Toto\n   \n   , and the\n   \n    Cowardly Lion\n   \n   . And then had the Winged Monkeys destroy their companions\n   \n    Scarecrow\n   \n   and\n   \n    Tin Woodman\n   \n   for trespassing in her land without permission. After the Witch was defeated and melted by Dorothy, the girl took the cap and used it to travel back to the\n   \n    Emerald City\n   \n   and to Oz's southern quadrant known as the\n   \n    Quadling Country\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Then\n   \n    Glinda\n   \n   the Good Witch who ruled over the native\n   \n    Quadlings\n   \n   , gladly took the cap and returned Dorothy's companions to their homes after Dorothy used the\n   \n    Silver Shoes\n   \n   she was wearing to return her and Toto to\n   \n    Kansas\n   \n   . Then she gave the Golden Cap back to the Winged Monkeys, breaking the curse and finally freeing them forever. After that the Winged Monkeys disappeared to live a new peaceful life somewhere in Oz.\n   \n    (\n    \n     The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\n    \n    )\n   \n\n\n\n    In Films\n   \n\n\n\n    The Golden Cap made a small cameo appearance in the 1939 film in a few of\n    \n     Margaret Hamilton\n    \n    's scenes in her castle. It was seen in the hands of a Flying Monkey, who gave it to the Wicked Witch of the West, though she did not speak the cap's incantation.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Now a first-year, Yuta learns Jujutsu and combat arts alongside his new peers: Maki Zenin, a Cursed Tools user, Toge Inumaki, a Cursed Speech user, and Panda, a seemingly talking panda bear.\n  \n\n   Thanks to connections made with friends and finding his place at Jujutsu High, Yuta begins to gain the confidence to feel alive. He even begins to become comfortable with his abilities. However, as the training progresses Yuta learns that the dangers of the Jujutsu World go far beyond that of evil spirits.\n  \n\n\n    Characters\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Yuta Okkotsu\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Satoru Gojo\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Maki Zenin\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Toge Inumaki\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Panda\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Suguru Geto\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Volume 0\n   \n\n\n\n    Main article:\n    Volumes & Chapters\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It began serialization in Weekly Shonen Jump on March 5, 2018, and serves as a sequel to a prequel series called Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Jujutsu High. The story blends dark fantasy, supernatural elements, and action, following the life of Yuji Itadori, a high school student who joins a world of jujutsu sorcerers after accidentally ingesting a powerful cursed object. This draws him into battles against cursed spirits, where he teams up with characters like Megumi Fushiguro and the enigmatic Satoru Gojo.\n\nIn terms of key elements:\n- **Plot**: The series explores themes of curses, sorcery, and personal growth, with Yuji navigating a dangerous world while honoring a promise to his late grandfather to help others.\n- **Main Characters**: Besides Yuji, you'll meet Megumi Fushiguro (a skilled sorcerer), Satoru Gojo (a powerful mentor figure), and others like Nobara Kugisaki, each with unique abilities and backstories.\n- **Author**: Gege Akutami, a Japanese manga artist, is known for his dynamic storytelling and has built a reputation through this series after earlier one-shots.\n- **Cultural Significance**: Jujutsu Kaisen has become a massive hit in the anime and manga community, with over 50 million copies sold worldwide.

It's often recommended for fans of series like Naruto or Demon Slayer due to its themes of friendship, power, and supernatural battles.\n\nIf you're looking for personal entertainment, it's a great entry point into modern shonen manga—start with the manga on platforms like Manga Plus or watch the anime on streaming services like Crunchyroll.

Her spirit no longer appears as the sweet girl he called his beloved. Instead, her spirit has been cursed and she manifests as a monstrous entity who protects him against his will.\n  \n\n   Unable to control Rika's immense power, Yuta is helpless to stop the bloodshed caused by his curse. As a result, Yuta is apprehended by Jujutsu Sorcerers, secret guardians of the world who are trained to combat Cursed Spirits like Rika. Yuta wishes to die in complete isolation so no one else can get hurt, but Satoru Gojo offers him a different path.\n  \n\n   Gojo has Yuta join Jujutsu High, where he studies with other sorcerers in training in order to control Rika in hopes of helping other people. Now a first-year, Yuta learns Jujutsu and combat arts alongside his new peers: Maki Zenin, a Cursed Tools user, Toge Inumaki, a Cursed Speech user, and Panda, a seemingly talking panda bear.\n  \n\n   Thanks to connections made with friends and finding his place at Jujutsu High, Yuta begins to gain the confidence to feel alive. He even begins to become comfortable with his abilities. However, as the training progresses Yuta learns that the dangers of the Jujutsu World go far beyond that of evil spirits.\n  \n\n\n    Characters\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Yuta Okkotsu\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Satoru Gojo\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Maki Zenin\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Toge Inumaki\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Panda\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   Suguru Geto\n                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Volume 0\n   \n\n\n\n    Main article:\n    Volumes & Chapters\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "question": "what is Jujutsu Kaisen and where is it most prevalent ",
    "response": "Jujutsu Kaisen is a popular Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami, serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump since March 2018. It follows the story of Yuji Itadori, a high school student who becomes involved in a world of jujutsu sorcerers fighting cursed spirits after swallowing a powerful cursed object. The series blends dark fantasy, supernatural elements, and action, exploring themes of curses, battles, and personal growth. It originated from a 2017 prequel one-shot titled \"Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Jujutsu High,\" which was later expanded into the main series.\n\nAs for where it's most prevalent, Jujutsu Kaisen is originally from Japan and remains highly popular there due to its publication in Weekly Shonen Jump and its cultural ties to Japanese media. Globally, it's widespread through digital platforms like Manga Plus (for simulcast chapters), anime streaming services (e.g., Crunchyroll or Netflix for the adaptation by Studio MAPPA, which started in 2020), and merchandise. With over 50 million copies in circulation worldwide by 2021, it's especially prominent in anime/manga communities in Asia, North America, and Europe. If you're considering diving in, start with the manga on Manga Plus for free chapters or the anime on streaming platforms—it's a great entry point if you enjoy action-packed stories with supernatural themes.",

He is a 35-year-old human and a failing comedian who was turned into a sorcerer by Kenjaku to participate in the Culling Game. Known for his goofy and comedy-focused personality, he often makes jokes in serious situations, despite not being funny to others.

He's very outspoken and comedy-focused in everything he does. While Fumihiko is the only person who thinks he's fun, he'll still tell jokes in serious situations that will get no laughs in response. This is why Fumihiki is a failing comedian. Despite the awkwardness or seriousness of any situation, Fumihiko will always try to entertain anyone who's around.\n  \n\n   In the deadly Culling Game, Fumihiko never appears phased by the fact he's participating in a deathmatch. He helped\n   \n    Megumi\n   \n   simply because he's being ambushed and despite the stark contrast in their personalities, they were able to work well together. Fumihiko claims he can tell if someone is good or bad by their face and chose to help Megumi anyway despite having a \"bad one\".

In the dressing room, his manager scolds him for his poor performance and tell Fumihiko he should quit comedy or find something else, saddening him. His coworker, Ken tells him his jokes aren't bad, but there are two types of comedians, ones who are funny and ones who think they're funny. He asks which of them is he, and Fumihiko replies he's about 50:50, but then rephrases by saying 70:30.\n  \n\n\n    Tokyo No. 1 Colony Arc\n   \n\n\n   When\n   \n    Megumi Fushiguro\n   \n   is cornered by\n   \n    Reggie Star\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iori Hazenoki\n   \n   , Takaba arrives at the last minute and protects the teenager, taunting his opponents and calling them cowards for going two against one.\n  \n\n\n    Abilities and Powers\n   \n\n\n   Takaba's power is\n   \n    Comedian\n   \n   .

    "question": "Who is the Jujusu Kaisen?",
    "response": "I think you meant \"Jujutsu Kaisen\" – it's a popular Japanese manga series, not a person! Created by manga artist Gege Akutami, it follows the story of Yuji Itadori, a high school student who gets pulled into a world of curses and sorcery after swallowing a cursed object. The series blends action, dark fantasy, and supernatural themes, exploring topics like friendship, power, and the human spirit in the face of evil.\n\nJujutsu Kaisen has become a cultural phenomenon, with over 50 million copies sold worldwide, an anime adaptation, and even a movie. It's a great entry point for exploring Japanese manga, as it showcases modern storytelling with elements of horror and adventure. If you'd like more details on the plot, characters, or its significance, just let me know!",

    "question": "What exactly is Jujutsu Kaisen?",
    "response": "Jujutsu Kaisen is a popular Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It began serialization in March 2018 in Weekly Shonen Jump and is an ongoing story in the dark fantasy, supernatural, and action genres. The series serves as a sequel to a prequel short series called Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Jujutsu High.\n\nAt its core, the plot follows Yuji Itadori, a high school student who starts off uninterested in the supernatural but gets pulled into a hidden world of jujutsu sorcerers and cursed spirits. After a fateful encounter involving a cursed object, Yuji joins a special school for sorcerers, where he teams up with characters like Megumi Fushiguro to battle dangerous curses and protect people. The story explores themes of power, curses, and human connections, blending intense action with emotional depth.\n\nKey characters include:\n- **Yuji Itadori**: The protagonist, an athletic and kind-hearted teen who becomes entangled in the jujutsu world.\n- **Megumi Fushiguro**: A skilled sorcerer and Yuji's ally, known for his strategic mind and summoning abilities.\n- **Satoru Gojo**: A powerful and charismatic teacher at the jujutsu school, often serving as a mentor figure.\n\nCulturally, Jujutsu Kaisen has become one of the best-selling manga series, with over 50 million copies in circulation worldwide. It reflects common elements in Japanese manga, such as supernatural battles and personal growth, and has gained global popularity through its 2020 anime adaptation by Studio MAPPA, which includes seasons and promotional content. This series highlights the appeal of the supernatural genre by blending horror, adventure, and character-driven narratives, making it a great entry point for exploring Japanese pop culture.\n\nIf you're curious about diving in, I recommend starting with the manga on platforms like Manga Plus or watching the anime on streaming services.

    "question": "What's Enter the Gungeon about?",
    "response": "Enter the Gungeon is a top-down roguelike dungeon crawler developed by Dodge Roll and published by Devolver Digital. In the game, players control misfit characters known as Gungeoneers who explore the procedurally generated Gungeon—a dangerous, ever-changing labyrinth filled with enemies, bosses, and bizarre weapons. The core gameplay involves fast-paced action, where players fight waves of Gundead enemies using a variety of guns and items, while utilizing mechanics like dodging and combo-building to survive. The plot centers on the Gungeoneers' quest for personal absolution, such as the Gunslinger attempting to kill his past self to rewrite history, leading to intense battles and interactions with iconic NPCs like vendors and quest-givers. Key features include procedural generation for unique runs, a wide array of weapons and items that change gameplay dynamically, and encounters with memorable characters and bosses, making each attempt a challenging and replayable experience.",

Unfortunately, this created a fractured timeline, and now the Gungeon has become a paradox, and begins to crumble.

Ham also said that even though some find the idea \"ridiculous,\" there is \"plenty of evidence\" to show that dinosaurs and man once lived together.\n  \n\n   In a blog post on his Answers in Genesis website earlier this week, Ham commented on the upcoming \"The Good Dinosaur\" movie, about a relationship between a human boy and a dinosaur, which is set to be released in November.\n  \n\n   Ham noted that it's rare that Hollywood portrays dinosaurs and humans living together, but said that that the film's trailer exposes its \"evolutionary presuppositions.\"\n  \n\n   \"The idea that an asteroid impacted Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is an idea that flows from an evolutionary way of thinking and that uses an evolutionary timeline. Although the trailer was brief, it seems likely that the final cut of the movie will contain evolutionary content,\" Ham states.\n  \n\n   \"And, unfortunately, this new film will be watched by many children and will only reinforce evolutionary ideas about the history of Earth. Even though it's a fiction, nonetheless it will buttress the false beliefs about dinosaurs that children are taught through much of the media and education system.\"\n  \n\n   Ham, whose organization supports a literal interpretation of Genesis and rejects the idea that the Earth is billions of years old, further argues in the articles that there is \"plenty of evidence that dinosaurs and mankind once lived together.\"\n  \n\n\n    Species\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Acrocanthosaurus\n    \n    (cut)\n   \n\n    Alexornis\n   \n\n    Alphadon\n   \n\n    Ankylosaurus\n    (cut)\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Apatosaurus\n    \n\n\n    Aptenoperissus\n   \n\n\n\n    Avisaurus\n   \n\n    Bison latifrons\n   \n\n    Blapsium\n   \n\n\n     Caudipteryx\n    \n\n\n    Caulkicephalus\n   \n\n    Cronopio\n   \n\n    Deinosuchus\n    - (mentioned as croc)\n   \n\n    Didelphodon\n   \n\n\n     Diplodocus\n    \n\n\n    Enantiornis\n   \n\n    Entoptychus\n   \n\n    Geosternbergia\n    (cut)\n   \n\n    Gobiconodon\n   \n\n    Hesperocyon\n   \n\n    Holmesina\n   \n\n    Hylonomus\n   \n\n    Ichthyornis\n   \n\n    Ludodactylus\n   \n\n    Milleretta\n   \n\n    Megalibgwilia\n   \n\n    Nyctosaurus\n   \n\n    Palaeothyris\n   \n\n    Paramacellodus\n   \n\n\n     Parasaurolophus\n    \n\n\n    Petrolacosaurus\n   \n\n    Platyhystrix\n   \n\n\n     Stegosaurus\n    \n    - (mentioned as Steggos; cut)\n   \n\n    Styracosaurus\n   \n\n    Tetrapodophis\n   \n\n\n     Triceratops\n    \n    (cut)\n   \n\n\n     Tyrannosaurus rex\n    \n\n\n\n     Velociraptor\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Dinosauria\n      \n\n       Temporal range:\n       \n        Late Triassic–Present\n       \n\n\n\n          PreЄ\n         \n\n\n\n          Є\n         \n\n\n\n          O\n         \n\n\n\n          S\n         \n\n\n\n          D\n         \n\n\n\n          C\n         \n\n\n\n          P\n         \n\n\n\n          T\n         \n\n\n\n          J\n         \n\n\n\n          K\n         \n\n\n\n\n           Pg\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           N\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Several dinosaur genera to scale\n     \n\n\n\n      Scientific classification\n     \n\n\n\n      Domain:\n     \n\n\n       Eukaryota\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Kingdom:\n     \n\n\n\n        Animalia\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n      Phylum:\n     \n\n\n\n        Chordata\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n      Class:\n     \n\n\n\n        Sauropsida\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Clade\n      \n      :\n     \n\n\n       Dinosauromorpha\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       Clade\n      \n      :\n     \n\n\n       Dinosauriformes\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Superorder:\n     \n\n\n\n        Dinosauria\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n      Major subgroups\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           †\n          \n\n\n\n         Ornithischia\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           †\n          \n\n\n\n         Sauropodomorpha\n        \n\n\n\n         Theropoda\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Dinosaurs\n   \n   (\n   \n    Owen\n   \n   , 1842) are a clade of\n   \n    vertebrate\n   \n\n    animals\n   \n   that dominated terrestrial ecosystems for approximately 170 million years, first appearing roughly 240 million years ago. At the end of the\n   \n    Cretaceous\n   \n   Period, 66 million years ago, non-avian dinosaurs suffered a\n   \n    catastrophic extinction\n   \n   , which ended their dominance on land. Taxonomists state that\n   \n    birds\n   \n   are the only remaining dinosaurs today, since birds are direct descendants of\n   \n    theropod\n   \n   dinosaurs, birds retain some dinosaurian features.\n  \n\n   Since the first dinosaur was recognized in the 19th century, mounted, fossilized dinosaur skeletons have become major attractions at museums around the world. Dinosaurs have become a part of world culture and remain consistently popular, especially among children. They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as\n   \n    Jurassic Park\n   \n   , and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.\n  \n\n   The term dinosaur is sometimes used informally to describe other prehistoric reptiles, such as the synapsid\n   \n\n     Dimetrodon\n    \n\n   , the winged\n   \n    pterosaurs\n   \n   and the aquatic\n   \n    Ichthyosaurs\n   \n   , plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, although technically none of these were dinosaurs.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       What is a dinosaur?\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Definition\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Size\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Behavior\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Evolution of dinosaurs\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Study of dinosaurs\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         The Current \"Dinosaur Renaissance\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Classification\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Order Saurischia\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Areas of debate\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n         Warm-bloodedness\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.2\n        \n\n         Feathered dinosaurs and the bird connection\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.1\n          \n\n           Feathers\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.2\n          \n\n           Skeleton\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.3\n          \n\n           Reproductive biology\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.4\n          \n\n           Lungs\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.5\n          \n\n           Heart and sleeping posture\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.6\n          \n\n           Gizzard\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         4.3\n        \n\n         Evidence for Cenozoic dinosaurs\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.4\n        \n\n         Bringing dinosaurs back to life\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.5\n        \n\n         Soft tissue in dinosaur fossils\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Extinction theories\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Asteroid collision\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Multiple collisions—the Oort cloud\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Environment changes\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       History of discovery\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Popular Culture\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Religious views\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What is a dinosaur?\n   \n\n\n\n    Definition\n   \n\n\n   The taxon Dinosauria was formally named by the English Palaeontologist\n   \n    Richard Owen\n   \n   in 1842 as \"a distinct tribe or suborder of Saurian\n   \n    reptiles\n   \n   \".[1] The term is derived from the Greek words δεινός (deinos meaning \"terrible\", \"fearsome\" or \"formidable\") and σαύρα (saura meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\"). Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

    "response": "Dinosaurs existed for a vast period in Earth's history. Here's a clear summary of their timeline based on what we know from paleontology:\n\n- **First Appearance**: Dinosaurs first emerged around 240 million years ago during the Late Triassic period. This marks the beginning of their presence on Earth.\n  \n- **Dominance Period**: They dominated terrestrial ecosystems for approximately 170 million years, evolving into a wide variety of species that adapted to different environments.\n\n- **Extinction**: Non-avian dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, likely due to a catastrophic event like an asteroid impact.\n\nIt's important to note that while non-avian dinosaurs are extinct, birds are considered the living descendants of theropod dinosaurs, meaning dinosaurs in a broader sense are still with us today.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

    "question": "what is your favorite dinosaur?",
    "response": "As an AI, I don't have personal favorites like humans do, but I find the Tyrannosaurus rex absolutely fascinating based on what I've learned from sources like Dinosaur Simulator, The Good Dinosaur, and Dinosaur Train! In Dinosaur Simulator, it's one of the default dinosaurs you can play as, highlighting its role as a powerful carnivore that hunts for food to survive. From The Good Dinosaur movie, we see how T. rex characters might interact in a prehistoric world, emphasizing their strength and predatory nature. And in Dinosaur Train, Buddy the T. rex is a curious explorer who learns about different dinosaurs, showing how T. rex had massive jaws for tearing meat, lived in forests and plains during the Cretaceous period, and was an apex predator that helped maintain ecosystem balance by controlling other animal populations.\n\nWhat makes T. rex so cool is its physical features—like those tiny arms that were actually quite strong for grabbing, a huge tail for balance, and teeth as long as bananas! They roamed habitats in what we now call North America, adapting to environments with lots of prey. If you're interested, we could dive deeper into why dinosaurs like this thrived or compare it to others in the context. What's your favorite dinosaur, and what draws you to it? I'd love to hear and share more facts!",

It was released to the cinemas in the USA on 25 November 2015.\n   The film stars Raymond Ochoa, Jack Bright, Sam Elliott, Anna Paquin, A. J. Buckley, Steve Zahn, Frances McDormand, Jeffrey Wright, and Marcus Scribner. Bob Peterson, who came up with the idea for the story, directed the film until August 2013. In October 2014, Peter Sohn was announced as the new director. The film, along with Inside Out, marks the first time that Pixar has released two feature films in the same year. The Good Dinosaur had its premiere on November 10, 2015 in Paris, and had its general release in the United States on November 25, 2015.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Plot\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Cast\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Video game\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Critical response\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Creationism\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Species\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Plot\n   \n\n\n   In an alternate timeline in which Earth was never hit by an impact event and dinosaurs never became extinct, a young Apatosaurus named Arlo loses his father in a tragic accident. One day, Arlo falls into a river and gets knocked out by a rock, finding himself far away from his home.

Before the rescheduling from 2014 to 2015, a Monsters University short film titled Party Central was set to accompany the film, but was instead shown with the theatrical release of Muppets Most Wanted. In April 2015, it was announced that a new Pixar short, Sanjay's Super Team, directed by Sanjay Patel will be shown in front of The Good Dinosaur instead.\n  \n\n   The film's teaser trailer was released on June 2, 2015 and the first official trailer was released on July 21, 2015.\n  \n\n   The film received an exclusive run at The Grand Rex in Paris a week before its U.S. and European premiere.\n  \n\n\n    Critical response\n   \n\n\n   Early reviews have been generally positive. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 76 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n  \n\n\n    Creationism\n   \n\n\n   Creation Museum CEO and President Ken Ham has spoken out\n   \n    against\n   \n   the upcoming Disney Pixar film \"The Good Dinosaur,\" which he said is likely to have\n   \n    evolution themes\n   \n   (Only one snake with legs for\n   \n    five\n   \n   seconds). Ham also said that even though some find the idea \"ridiculous,\" there is \"plenty of evidence\" to show that dinosaurs and man once lived together.\n  \n\n   In a blog post on his Answers in Genesis website earlier this week, Ham commented on the upcoming \"The Good Dinosaur\" movie, about a relationship between a human boy and a dinosaur, which is set to be released in November.\n  \n\n   Ham noted that it's rare that Hollywood portrays dinosaurs and humans living together, but said that that the film's trailer exposes its \"evolutionary presuppositions.\"\n  \n\n   \"The idea that an asteroid impacted Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is an idea that flows from an evolutionary way of thinking and that uses an evolutionary timeline. Although the trailer was brief, it seems likely that the final cut of the movie will contain evolutionary content,\" Ham states.\n  \n\n   \"And, unfortunately, this new film will be watched by many children and will only reinforce evolutionary ideas about the history of Earth. Even though it's a fiction, nonetheless it will buttress the false beliefs about dinosaurs that children are taught through much of the media and education system.\"\n  \n\n   Ham, whose organization supports a literal interpretation of Genesis and rejects the idea that the Earth is billions of years old, further argues in the articles that there is \"plenty of evidence that dinosaurs and mankind once lived together.\"\n  \n\n\n    Species\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Acrocanthosaurus\n    \n    (cut)\n   \n\n    Alexornis\n   \n\n    Alphadon\n   \n\n    Ankylosaurus\n    (cut)\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Apatosaurus\n    \n\n\n    Aptenoperissus\n   \n\n\n\n    Avisaurus\n   \n\n    Bison latifrons\n   \n\n    Blapsium\n   \n\n\n     Caudipteryx\n    \n\n\n    Caulkicephalus\n   \n\n    Cronopio\n   \n\n    Deinosuchus\n    - (mentioned as croc)\n   \n\n    Didelphodon\n   \n\n\n     Diplodocus\n    \n\n\n    Enantiornis\n   \n\n    Entoptychus\n   \n\n    Geosternbergia\n    (cut)\n   \n\n    Gobiconodon\n   \n\n    Hesperocyon\n   \n\n    Holmesina\n   \n\n    Hylonomus\n   \n\n    Ichthyornis\n   \n\n    Ludodactylus\n   \n\n    Milleretta\n   \n\n    Megalibgwilia\n   \n\n    Nyctosaurus\n   \n\n    Palaeothyris\n   \n\n    Paramacellodus\n   \n\n\n     Parasaurolophus\n    \n\n\n    Petrolacosaurus\n   \n\n    Platyhystrix\n   \n\n\n     Stegosaurus\n    \n    - (mentioned as Steggos; cut)\n   \n\n    Styracosaurus\n   \n\n    Tetrapodophis\n   \n\n\n     Triceratops\n    \n    (cut)\n   \n\n\n     Tyrannosaurus rex\n    \n\n\n\n     Velociraptor\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Jim Henson's Dinosaur Train\n    \n\n   is a preschool television series produced by The Jim Henson Company for PBS Kids.\n   \n    Dinosaur Train\n   \n   is designed to help encourage basic scientific thinking and skills as the audience learns about natural science, natural history and paleontology. The computer-animated series, with animation outsourced to Singapore, consists of forty episodes.\n  \n\n   Created by Craig Bartlett,\n   \n    Dinosaur Train\n   \n   follows the adventures of a young Tyrannosaurus rex and his adoptive family of Pteranodons.\n  \n\n   The show is set in a whimsical prehistoric world of jungles, swamps, active volcanoes and oceans, all teeming with dinosaur and other animal life, and connected by a train line known as the Dinosaur Train. This steam-engine train is customized for dinosaurs of all kinds: windows accommodate the long-necked sauropods, there’s plenty of headroom in the Observation Car for the larger theropods, and the Aquacar is an aquarium for sea-going passengers. The train itself is run by\n   \n\n     Troodon\n    \n\n   s (who get to run it because they’re the smartest dinosaurs, as they often explain, and have nimble toe claws to punch the tickets). The Dinosaur Train circles the whole world—it even crosses the oceans and inland seas, with stops to visit undersea prehistoric animals. It also has the ability to visit the entire Mesozoic Era, the “Age of Dinosaurs,” passing through magical Time Tunnels to meet the dinosaurs in the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous time periods.\n  \n\n   The world of Dinosaur Train is seen through the eyes of Buddy, the preschool-age\n   \n\n     Tyrannosaurus\n    \n\n   . In the show’s main title song, we learn that Buddy was adopted by Mr. and Mrs.\n   \n    Pteranodon\n   \n   and brought to their nest to hatch at the same time as his siblings Tiny, Shiny, and Don. By traveling in the Dinosaur Train around the Mesozoic, assisted with all dinosaur facts by the train’s\n   \n    Troodon\n   \n   Conductor, Buddy quickly learns that he is a\n   \n    Tyrannosaurus\n   \n   . As an adopted kid in a mixed-species family, Buddy is especially curious about the differences between species and vows to learn about all the dinosaurs he can by riding the Dinosaur Train.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur Train is co-produced and animated by Sparky Animation Studios in Singapore, with casting by Vidaspark and voice-overs recorded at Kozmic Sound in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It premiered on Labor Day 2009 and airs daily on PBS Kids, and in various countries around the world. 40 half-hour episodes have been ordered by PBS Kids so far. Each episode is followed by a live-action segment featuring Dinosaur Train educational consultant and world-renowned paleontologist Dr. Scott D. Sampson, who appears onscreen to explain the show’s dinosaur curriculum in greater detail, sometimes assisted by a character known as “Mr. Disclaimer” (played by Dinosaur Train Story Editor Joe Purdy), who points out details like “Dinosaurs did not actually perform musical concerts,” or “Dinosaurs did not actually play Dinoball.”\n  \n\n   Main Characters\n  \n\n\n\n     Buddy\n    \n    (voiced by Phillip Corlett) – A curious and intelligent\n    \n\n      T-Rex\n     \n\n    who likes to ask questions and form hypotheses. He was adopted by the\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    family after being discovered as an egg. Some episodes name him \"Buddy Tyrannosaurus\" while others name him \"Buddy Pterandon\". Since Buddy is incapable of flight, as all T-Rex dinosaurs were, he is the spotter for the Pteranodon family, which means it is his job to spot fish for the Pteranodons to catch. Buddy's color is Orange in his family.\n   \n\n\n     Tiny\n    \n    (voiced by Claire Corlett) – A\n    \n\n      Pteranodon\n     \n\n    who likes rhymes and approaches dinosaurs with the confidence of a news reporter. Tiny's color is Green like Don and her parents.\n   \n\n\n     Shiny\n    \n    (voiced by Erika-Shaye Gair) – A\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    who is less tomboyish than Tiny and loves roleplaying with her siblings. Shiny is a\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    just like her parents and Don and Tiny, except that her color is Aqua, making her different from her family whose color appears Green.\n   \n\n\n     Don\n    \n    (voiced by Alexander Matthew Marr) – A goofy\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    who enjoys dancing and having a collection. Don is a\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    like his parents and sisters, only he's a little wider than Shiny and Tiny.\n   \n\n\n     Mr. Conductor\n    \n    (voiced by Ian James Corlett) – A\n    \n\n      Troodon\n     \n\n    who operates the Dinosaur Train. He is a special friend to Buddy; although he prefers to be called Mr. Conductor by everyone except his mother (Mrs. Troodon) and Don (who calls him \"Mr. The Conductor\" by mistake). Whenever the Dinosaur Train approaches a time tunnel, the conductor says, \"Time Tunnel, Time Tunnel Approaching!\" He also hides his feathers under his hat. Mr. Conductor gets shy around his mother.\n   \n\n\n     Mrs. Pteranodon\n    \n    (voiced by Ellen Kennedy) – The mother. She is a teacher, companion, very nice and thinks of herself as the ultimate tour guide. Unlike most other adult female characters in the series, her first name is never revealed in the series. Her children introduce her to other dinosaurs as \"Our Mom, 'Mom'.\"\n   \n\n\n     Mr. Pteranodon\n    \n    (voiced by Colin Murdock) – The father of the\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    family. He likes to think of himself as the family's coach. One of his interests is taking Don and Shiny on fishing expeditions while Buddy and Tiny ride the Dinosaur Train with his wife.\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n      1\n     \n\n      Episodes\n     \n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Season 1\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Season 2\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Season 3\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Season 4\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Season 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Specials and TV films\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Species\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Season 1\n   \n\n\n\n    Valley of the Stygimolochs / Tiny Loves Fish [ 2009 ] (lessons taught:\n    \n\n      Stygimoloch\n     \n\n    /\n    \n\n      Pteranodon\n     \n\n    )\n   \n\n    The Call of the Wild Corythosaurus / Triceratops for Lunch [ 2009 ] (lessons taught:\n    \n     Corythosaurus\n    \n    /\n    \n\n      Triceratops\n     \n\n    )\n   \n\n    Beating the Heat / Flowers for Mom [ 2009 ] (lessons taught:\n    \n\n      Stegosaurus\n     \n\n    / Bees)\n   \n\n    I'm a T.

    "question": "What was the first type of Dinosaur?",
    "response": "The first types of dinosaurs appeared around 240 million years ago during the Late Triassic period. These early dinosaurs were likely members of the Saurischia group, which includes subgroups like early theropods and sauropodomorphs. For example, primitive dinosaurs such as Eoraptor or Herrerasaurus were small, bipedal predators that walked on two legs and were mostly carnivorous. They had key characteristics like a perforate hip socket, reduced fingers on their hands, and an upright stance, which allowed for efficient movement on land. This marks the beginning of dinosaur evolution, leading to the diverse groups we study today, and highlights their role as dominant terrestrial animals in Earth's history.",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed.

Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

    "response": "Dinosaurs are fascinating creatures that star in games like Dinosaur Simulator on Roblox, where you can live as one and survive in a prehistoric world. But in real science, dinosaurs were a diverse group of vertebrate animals that first appeared about 240 million years ago and dominated land ecosystems for around 170 million years until a mass extinction event about 66 million years ago.\n\nScientifically, dinosaurs are defined as a clade—a group of organisms sharing a common ancestor—based on key characteristics called synapomorphies. These include features like a perforate acetabulum (a hip socket with a hole in the center), reduced digits on their hands and feet (usually three main toes on each foot), and a structure that allowed for an upright stance, making them efficient walkers and even runners. This setup helped many dinosaurs walk on two legs (bipedal) or four (quadrupedal).\n\nDinosaurs are classified into two main groups based on their hip structure: \n- **Ornithischia** (bird-hipped dinosaurs), which includes herbivores like Triceratops, with a pelvis that points backward.\n- **Saurischia** (lizard-hipped dinosaurs), which includes giants like sauropods and carnivores like Tyrannosaurus rex, with a pelvis that points forward.\n\nAn exciting fact is their evolutionary link to birds! Birds are considered the living descendants of theropod dinosaurs, a subgroup of Saurischia. This means dinosaurs aren't entirely extinct—birds today retain some dinosaurian features, like certain bone structures and behaviors seen in fossils of dinosaurs like Oviraptor.\n\nIf you're playing Dinosaur Simulator, think about how these real traits might inspire your gameplay—maybe try surviving as a Triceratops and imagine its real-world adaptations!

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed.

They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as\n   \n    Jurassic Park\n   \n   , and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.\n  \n\n   The term dinosaur is sometimes used informally to describe other prehistoric reptiles, such as the synapsid\n   \n\n     Dimetrodon\n    \n\n   , the winged\n   \n    pterosaurs\n   \n   and the aquatic\n   \n    Ichthyosaurs\n   \n   , plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, although technically none of these were dinosaurs.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       What is a dinosaur?\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Definition\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Size\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Behavior\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Evolution of dinosaurs\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Study of dinosaurs\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         The Current \"Dinosaur Renaissance\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Classification\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Order Saurischia\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Areas of debate\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n         Warm-bloodedness\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.2\n        \n\n         Feathered dinosaurs and the bird connection\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.1\n          \n\n           Feathers\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.2\n          \n\n           Skeleton\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.3\n          \n\n           Reproductive biology\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.4\n          \n\n           Lungs\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.5\n          \n\n           Heart and sleeping posture\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.6\n          \n\n           Gizzard\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         4.3\n        \n\n         Evidence for Cenozoic dinosaurs\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.4\n        \n\n         Bringing dinosaurs back to life\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.5\n        \n\n         Soft tissue in dinosaur fossils\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Extinction theories\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Asteroid collision\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Multiple collisions—the Oort cloud\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Environment changes\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       History of discovery\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Popular Culture\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Religious views\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What is a dinosaur?\n   \n\n\n\n    Definition\n   \n\n\n   The taxon Dinosauria was formally named by the English Palaeontologist\n   \n    Richard Owen\n   \n   in 1842 as \"a distinct tribe or suborder of Saurian\n   \n    reptiles\n   \n   \".[1] The term is derived from the Greek words δεινός (deinos meaning \"terrible\", \"fearsome\" or \"formidable\") and σαύρα (saura meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\"). Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

The computer-animated series, with animation outsourced to Singapore, consists of forty episodes.\n  \n\n   Created by Craig Bartlett,\n   \n    Dinosaur Train\n   \n   follows the adventures of a young Tyrannosaurus rex and his adoptive family of Pteranodons.\n  \n\n   The show is set in a whimsical prehistoric world of jungles, swamps, active volcanoes and oceans, all teeming with dinosaur and other animal life, and connected by a train line known as the Dinosaur Train. This steam-engine train is customized for dinosaurs of all kinds: windows accommodate the long-necked sauropods, there’s plenty of headroom in the Observation Car for the larger theropods, and the Aquacar is an aquarium for sea-going passengers. The train itself is run by\n   \n\n     Troodon\n    \n\n   s (who get to run it because they’re the smartest dinosaurs, as they often explain, and have nimble toe claws to punch the tickets). The Dinosaur Train circles the whole world—it even crosses the oceans and inland seas, with stops to visit undersea prehistoric animals. It also has the ability to visit the entire Mesozoic Era, the “Age of Dinosaurs,” passing through magical Time Tunnels to meet the dinosaurs in the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous time periods.\n  \n\n   The world of Dinosaur Train is seen through the eyes of Buddy, the preschool-age\n   \n\n     Tyrannosaurus\n    \n\n   . In the show’s main title song, we learn that Buddy was adopted by Mr. and Mrs.\n   \n    Pteranodon\n   \n   and brought to their nest to hatch at the same time as his siblings Tiny, Shiny, and Don. By traveling in the Dinosaur Train around the Mesozoic, assisted with all dinosaur facts by the train’s\n   \n    Troodon\n   \n   Conductor, Buddy quickly learns that he is a\n   \n    Tyrannosaurus\n   \n   . As an adopted kid in a mixed-species family, Buddy is especially curious about the differences between species and vows to learn about all the dinosaurs he can by riding the Dinosaur Train.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur Train is co-produced and animated by Sparky Animation Studios in Singapore, with casting by Vidaspark and voice-overs recorded at Kozmic Sound in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It premiered on Labor Day 2009 and airs daily on PBS Kids, and in various countries around the world. 40 half-hour episodes have been ordered by PBS Kids so far. Each episode is followed by a live-action segment featuring Dinosaur Train educational consultant and world-renowned paleontologist Dr. Scott D. Sampson, who appears onscreen to explain the show’s dinosaur curriculum in greater detail, sometimes assisted by a character known as “Mr. Disclaimer” (played by Dinosaur Train Story Editor Joe Purdy), who points out details like “Dinosaurs did not actually perform musical concerts,” or “Dinosaurs did not actually play Dinoball.”\n  \n\n   Main Characters\n  \n\n\n\n     Buddy\n    \n    (voiced by Phillip Corlett) – A curious and intelligent\n    \n\n      T-Rex\n     \n\n    who likes to ask questions and form hypotheses. He was adopted by the\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    family after being discovered as an egg. Some episodes name him \"Buddy Tyrannosaurus\" while others name him \"Buddy Pterandon\". Since Buddy is incapable of flight, as all T-Rex dinosaurs were, he is the spotter for the Pteranodon family, which means it is his job to spot fish for the Pteranodons to catch. Buddy's color is Orange in his family.\n   \n\n\n     Tiny\n    \n    (voiced by Claire Corlett) – A\n    \n\n      Pteranodon\n     \n\n    who likes rhymes and approaches dinosaurs with the confidence of a news reporter. Tiny's color is Green like Don and her parents.\n   \n\n\n     Shiny\n    \n    (voiced by Erika-Shaye Gair) – A\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    who is less tomboyish than Tiny and loves roleplaying with her siblings. Shiny is a\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    just like her parents and Don and Tiny, except that her color is Aqua, making her different from her family whose color appears Green.\n   \n\n\n     Don\n    \n    (voiced by Alexander Matthew Marr) – A goofy\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    who enjoys dancing and having a collection. Don is a\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    like his parents and sisters, only he's a little wider than Shiny and Tiny.\n   \n\n\n     Mr. Conductor\n    \n    (voiced by Ian James Corlett) – A\n    \n\n      Troodon\n     \n\n    who operates the Dinosaur Train. He is a special friend to Buddy; although he prefers to be called Mr. Conductor by everyone except his mother (Mrs. Troodon) and Don (who calls him \"Mr. The Conductor\" by mistake). Whenever the Dinosaur Train approaches a time tunnel, the conductor says, \"Time Tunnel, Time Tunnel Approaching!\" He also hides his feathers under his hat. Mr. Conductor gets shy around his mother.\n   \n\n\n     Mrs. Pteranodon\n    \n    (voiced by Ellen Kennedy) – The mother. She is a teacher, companion, very nice and thinks of herself as the ultimate tour guide. Unlike most other adult female characters in the series, her first name is never revealed in the series. Her children introduce her to other dinosaurs as \"Our Mom, 'Mom'.\"\n   \n\n\n     Mr. Pteranodon\n    \n    (voiced by Colin Murdock) – The father of the\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    family. He likes to think of himself as the family's coach. One of his interests is taking Don and Shiny on fishing expeditions while Buddy and Tiny ride the Dinosaur Train with his wife.\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n      1\n     \n\n      Episodes\n     \n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Season 1\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Season 2\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Season 3\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Season 4\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Season 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Specials and TV films\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Species\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Season 1\n   \n\n\n\n    Valley of the Stygimolochs / Tiny Loves Fish [ 2009 ] (lessons taught:\n    \n\n      Stygimoloch\n     \n\n    /\n    \n\n      Pteranodon\n     \n\n    )\n   \n\n    The Call of the Wild Corythosaurus / Triceratops for Lunch [ 2009 ] (lessons taught:\n    \n     Corythosaurus\n    \n    /\n    \n\n      Triceratops\n     \n\n    )\n   \n\n    Beating the Heat / Flowers for Mom [ 2009 ] (lessons taught:\n    \n\n      Stegosaurus\n     \n\n    / Bees)\n   \n\n    I'm a T.

Dinosaurs lived from about 240 million years ago, starting in the Late Triassic period, until around 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. That's when most dinosaurs went extinct in a catastrophic event. However, birds, which evolved from dinosaur ancestors like theropods, are still around today, connecting prehistoric life to the modern world.",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

    "question": "what is the biggest dinosaur known to science? ",
    "response": "The biggest dinosaur known to science is likely Patagotitan mayorum, a massive sauropod from the Cretaceous period (about 100 million years ago). Based on fossil evidence discovered in Argentina in 2014, scientists estimate it could reach lengths of up to 37 meters (about 121 feet) and weigh around 70 tons—comparable to a space shuttle! This makes it one of the largest land animals ever to exist, far surpassing earlier candidates like Argentinosaurus, which might have been similar in size but with less complete fossils for precise measurements.\n\nKey characteristics include its long neck and tail, four massive legs like pillars, and a small head relative to its body, adaptations that helped it browse treetops in its evolutionary context as a member of the Sauropodomorpha group. These features evolved over millions of years, allowing dinosaurs to dominate terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nSize determinations are based on incomplete fossils, such as partial skeletons, so estimates can vary depending on how scientists reconstruct them—using comparisons with related species and advanced techniques like 3D modeling. This uncertainty highlights the ongoing role of scientific discoveries in refining our knowledge of prehistoric life, as new fossils continue to emerge.\n\nIf you're interested, I recommend exploring museum exhibits or resources on paleontology to learn more about how these giants lived and why they went extinct.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

    "question": "what period did the dinosaurs exist? ",
    "response": "Dinosaurs first appeared during the Late Triassic period, around 240 million years ago, and they dominated terrestrial ecosystems for about 170 million years. Non-avian dinosaurs, which are the ones most people think of like T. rex and Triceratops, went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, about 66 million years ago. However, birds, which are descendants of theropod dinosaurs, still exist today, making dinosaurs as a group continue to the present. This timeline helps illustrate how dinosaurs evolved and adapted over millions of years before their major extinction event.",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

    "question": "What is the tallest dinosaur of all time?",
    "response": "Based on paleontological studies, the tallest dinosaur of all time is generally considered to be from the group of long-necked sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus or possibly Sauroposeidon, which could reach heights of up to 18 meters (about 59 feet) at the shoulder and even taller when stretching their necks. While the provided context doesn't specify exact species or heights, it does highlight features like the erect stance and limb adaptations in dinosaurs—such as reduced digits on the feet and a straight femur—that likely contributed to the impressive sizes of sauropods. These dinosaurs evolved long necks and legs as adaptations for reaching high vegetation, showcasing the diversity in body proportions that helped them thrive in terrestrial environments.\n\nScientists estimate these heights by carefully studying fossilized bones, like measuring the length of neck vertebrae and leg bones from excavations. For example, a longer femur and multiple fused sacral vertebrae (as mentioned in the context) suggest an ability to support a tall, upright posture. This method isn't exact due to incomplete fossils, but it gives us a good idea based on comparisons with living animals.\n\nTo think critically about this, consider how physical features like limb structure influenced survival—taller dinosaurs might have accessed food others couldn't, but they also needed strong bones to support their weight. If you're curious, you could explore more about sauropod fossils or visit a museum to see reconstructions. What other dinosaur adaptations interest you?",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

    "question": "Where did the Dinosaurs go?",
    "response": "Dinosaurs, which dominated terrestrial ecosystems for about 170 million years, went extinct in a catastrophic event at the end of the Cretaceous Period, around 66 million years ago. According to the context, several theories explain this extinction:\n\n- **Asteroid collision**: A major theory suggests that a large asteroid impact caused widespread devastation, leading to rapid environmental changes that wiped out non-avian dinosaurs.\n- **Multiple collisions—the Oort cloud**: Another possibility involves multiple asteroid or comet impacts from the Oort cloud, which could have compounded the effects and contributed to the extinction.\n- **Environmental changes**: Gradual shifts in the environment, such as climate alterations, volcanic activity, or sea-level changes, may have played a role, making survival impossible for many species.\n\nWhile birds, as descendants of theropod dinosaurs, survived and continue to exist today, non-avian dinosaurs did not. This explanation is based on evidence from fossil records and scientific studies mentioned in the context.",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed.

They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as\n   \n    Jurassic Park\n   \n   , and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.\n  \n\n   The term dinosaur is sometimes used informally to describe other prehistoric reptiles, such as the synapsid\n   \n\n     Dimetrodon\n    \n\n   , the winged\n   \n    pterosaurs\n   \n   and the aquatic\n   \n    Ichthyosaurs\n   \n   , plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, although technically none of these were dinosaurs.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       What is a dinosaur?\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Definition\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Size\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Behavior\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Evolution of dinosaurs\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Study of dinosaurs\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         The Current \"Dinosaur Renaissance\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Classification\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Order Saurischia\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Areas of debate\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n         Warm-bloodedness\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.2\n        \n\n         Feathered dinosaurs and the bird connection\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.1\n          \n\n           Feathers\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.2\n          \n\n           Skeleton\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.3\n          \n\n           Reproductive biology\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.4\n          \n\n           Lungs\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.5\n          \n\n           Heart and sleeping posture\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.6\n          \n\n           Gizzard\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         4.3\n        \n\n         Evidence for Cenozoic dinosaurs\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.4\n        \n\n         Bringing dinosaurs back to life\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.5\n        \n\n         Soft tissue in dinosaur fossils\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Extinction theories\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Asteroid collision\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Multiple collisions—the Oort cloud\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Environment changes\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       History of discovery\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Popular Culture\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Religious views\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What is a dinosaur?\n   \n\n\n\n    Definition\n   \n\n\n   The taxon Dinosauria was formally named by the English Palaeontologist\n   \n    Richard Owen\n   \n   in 1842 as \"a distinct tribe or suborder of Saurian\n   \n    reptiles\n   \n   \".[1] The term is derived from the Greek words δεινός (deinos meaning \"terrible\", \"fearsome\" or \"formidable\") and σαύρα (saura meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\"). Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

Although it shared the landscape with and was\n    preyed upon\n    by the fearsome\n   \n\n     Tyrannosaurus\n    \n\n   ,\n    it is unclear whether the two battled the way they are commonly depicted in movies, children's dinosaur books and many cartoons. The fossil can be found in the United States.\n  \n\n   A complete\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   skeleton has yet to be found;\n    however, the animal is well-known from numerous partial remains collected since the introduction of the genus in 1887. The function of their frills and three distinctive facial horns has long inspired debate. Although traditionally viewed as defensive weapons against predators, the latest theories claim that it is more probable that these features were used in courtship and dominance displays, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats, or rhinoceros beetles.\n  \n\n\n    Triceratops\n   \n   is the best-known of the ceratopsids, though the genus's exact placement within the group has been a point of contention amongst\n    paleontologists\n    .

It could grow to be over 2 meters (7 feet) in length,\n    and could reach almost a third of the length of the entire animal.\n    It bore a single horn on the snout, above the nostrils, and a pair of horns approximately 1 meters (3 feet) long, with one above each eye. To the rear of the skull was a relatively short, bony frill. Most other frilled dinosaurs had large\n    fenestrae\n    in their frills, while the frills of\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   were noticeably solid.\n   Anatosaurus\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   species possessed a sturdy build, with strong limbs and short five-hoofed hands and four-hoofed feet.\n    Although certainly quadrupedal, the posture of these dinosaurs has long been the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the\n    thorax\n    , in order to better bear the weight of the head.\n    This stance can be seen in paintings by\n    Charles Knight\n    and\n    Rudolph Zallinger\n    . However,\n    ichnological\n    evidence in the form of\n    trackways\n    from horned dinosaurs, and recent reconstructions of skeletons (both physical and digital) seem to show that\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion, with the elbows slightly bowed out, in an intermediate state between fully upright and fully sprawling (as in the modern rhinoceros).\n    This conclusion does not preclude a sprawling gait for confrontations or feeding.\n  \n\n   The one living animal today that has three horns like Triceratops is the Jackson's Chameleon.\n  \n\n\n    Classification\n   \n\n\n\n    Triceratops\n   \n   is the best known genus of the\n   \n    Ceratopsidae\n   \n   , a family of large North American horned dinosaurs. The exact location of\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   among the ceratopsians has been debated over the years. Confusion stemmed mainly from the combination of short, solid frills (similar to that of Centrosaurinae), and the long brow horns (more akin to Ceratopsinae, also known as Chasmosaurinae). In the first overview of horned dinosaurs,\n    R.S. Lull\n    hypothesized two lineages, one of\n   \n    Monoclonius\n   \n   and\n   \n\n     Centrosaurus\n    \n\n   leading to\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   , the other with\n   \n    Ceratops\n   \n   and\n   \n\n     Torosaurus\n    \n\n   , making\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   a centrosaurine as the group is understood today.\n    Later revisions supported this view, formally describing the first, short-frilled group as Centrosaurinae (including\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   ), and the second, long-frilled group as Chasmosaurinae.\n  \n\n   In 1949,\n    C.M. Sternberg\n    was the first to question this and favoured instead that\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   was more closely related to\n   \n    Arrhinoceratops\n   \n   and\n   \n\n     Chasmosaurus\n    \n\n   based on skull and horn features, making\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   a ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) genus.\n    However, he was largely ignored with\n    John Ostrom\n    ,\n    and later David Norman, both placing\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   within Centrosaurinae.\n  \n\n   Subsequent discoveries and analyses upheld Sternberg's view on the position of\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   , with Lehman defining both subfamilies in 1990 and diagnosing\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   as ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) on the basis of several morphological features. In fact, it fits well into the ceratopsine subfamily, apart from its one feature of a shortened frill.\n    Further research by\n    Peter Dodson\n    , including a 1990\n    cladistic\n    analysis\n    and a 1993 study using RFTRA (resistant-fit theta-rho analysis),\n    a\n    morphometric technique\n    which systematically measures similarities in skull shape, reinforces\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   placement in the ceratopsine subfamily.\n  \n\n\n    Use in phylogenetics\n   \n\n\n   In\n    phylogenetic taxonomy\n    , the genus has been used as a reference point in the definition of Dinosauria; Dinosaurs have been designated as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   and\n    Neornithes\n    (i.e. modern birds).\n    Furthermore, the bird-hipped dinosaurs,\n    Ornithischia\n    , have been designated as all dinosaurs with a more recent common ancestor to\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than modern birds.\n  \n\n\n    Ori \n\n\n\n\n\n    Ceratopsidae\n   \n   (sometimes spelled\n   \n    Ceratopidae\n   \n   ) is a speciose group ofmarginocephalian dinosaurs including\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   and\n   \n    Styracosaurus\n   \n   . All known species were quadrupedal herbivoresfrom the Upper Cretaceous, mainly of Western North America (though\n   \n    Sinoceratops\n   \n   is known from Asia)\n   and are characterized by beaks, rows of shearing teeth in the back of the jaw, and elaborate horns and frills. The group is divided into two subfamilies. The\n   \n    Ceratopsinae\n   \n   or\n   \n    Chasmosaurinae\n   \n   are generally characterized by long, triangular frills and well-developed brow horns. The\n   \n    Centrosaurinae\n   \n   had well-developed nasal horns or nasal bosses, shorter and more rectangular frills, and elaborate spines on the back of the frill.\n  \n\n   These horns and frills show remarkable variation and are the principal means by which the various species have been recognized. Their purpose is not entirely clear. Defense against predators is one possible purpose – although the frills are comparatively fragile in many species – but it is more likely that, as in modern ungulates, they may have beensecondary sexual characteristics used in displays or for intraspecific combat. The massive bosses on the skulls of\n   \n    Pachyrhinosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Achelousaurus\n   \n   resemble those formed by the base of the horns in modern musk oxen, suggesting that they may have butted heads. Centrosaurines have frequently been found in massive bone beds with few other species present, suggesting that the animals might have lived in large herds.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Paleobiology\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Behavior\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Diet\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Physiology\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Sexual dimorphism\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Evolution\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Paleoecology\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Classification\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Paleobiology\n   \n\n\n\n    Behavior\n   \n\n\n   Fossil deposits dominated large numbers of ceratopsids from individual species suggest that these animals were at least somewhat social.\n   However, the exact nature of ceratopsid social behavior has historically been controversial.\n   In 1997, Lehman argued that the aggregations of many individuals preserved in bonebeds originated as local \"infestations\" and compared them to similar modern occurrences in crocodiles and tortoises.\n   Other authors, such as Scott D. Sampson, interpret these deposits as the remains of large \"socially complex\" herds.\n  \n\n   Modern animals with mating signals as prominent as the horns and frills of ceratopsians tend to form these kinds of large, intricate associations.\n   Sampson found in previous work that the centrosaurine ceratopsids did not achieve fully developed mating signals until nearly fully grown.\n   He finds commonality between the slow growth of mating signals in centrosaurines and the extended adolescence of animals whose social structures are ranked hierarchies founded on age-related differences.\n   In these sorts of groups young males are typically sexually mature for several years before actually beginning to breed, when their mating signals are most fully developed.\n   Females, by contrast do not have such an extended adolescence.\n  \n\n   Other researchers who support the idea of ceratopsid herding have speculated that these associations were seasonal.\n   This hypothesis portrays ceratopsids as living in small groups near the coasts during the rainy season and inland with the onset of the dry season.\n   Support for the idea that ceratopsids formed herds inland comes from the greater abundance of bonebeds in inland deposits than coastal ones. The migration of ceratopsids away from the coasts may have represented a move to their nesting grounds.\n   Many African herding animals engage in this kind of seasonal herding today.\n   Herds would also have afforded some level of protection from the chief predators of ceratopsids, tyrannosaurids.\n  \n\n\n    Diet\n   \n\n\n   Ceratopsids were adapted to processing high-fiber plant material with their highly derived dental batteries.\n   They may have utilizedfermentation to break down plant material with a gut microflora.\n   Mallon et al. (2013) examined herbivore coexistence on the island continent ofLaramidia, during the Late Cretaceous. It was concluded that ceratopsids were generally restricted to feeding on vegetation at, or below, the height of 1 meter.\n  \n\n\n    Physiology\n   \n\n\n   Ceratopsians probably had the \"low mass-specific metabolic rat[e]\" typical of large bodied animals.\n  \n\n\n    Sexual dimorphism\n   \n\n\n   According to Scott D. Sampson, if ceratopsids were to have sexual dimorphism modern ecological analogues suggest it would be in their mating signals like horns and frills.\n   No convincing evidence for sexual dimorphism in body size or mating signals is known in ceratopsids, although was present in the more primitive ceratopsian\n   \n    Protoceratops andrewsi\n   \n   whose sexes were distinguishable based on frill and nasal prominence size.\n   This is consistent with other known tetrapod groups where midsized animals tended to exhibit markedly more sexual dimorphism than larger ones.\n   However, if there were sexually dimorphic traits they may have been soft tissue variations like colorations ordewlaps that would not have been preserved as fossils.\n  \n\n\n    Evolution\n   \n\n\n   Scott D. Sampson has compared the evolution of ceratopsids to that of some mammal groups: both were rapid from a geological perspective and precipitatied the simultaneous evolution of large body size, derived feeding structures, and \"varied hornlike organs.\"\n  \n\n\n    Paleoecology\n   \n\n\n   The chief predators of ceratopsids weretyrannosaurids.\n  \n\n   There is evidence for an aggressive interaction between a\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and a\n   \n\n     Tyrannosaurus\n    \n\n   in the form of partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   brow horn and squamosal (a bone of the neck frill); the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. It is not known what the exact nature of the interaction was, though: either animal could have been the aggressor.\n   Since the\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   wounds healed, it is most likely that the\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   survived the encounter and managed to overcome the\n   \n\n     Tyrannosaurus\n    \n\n   . Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   , the\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the\n   \n\n     Tyrannosaurus\n    \n\n   using its sharp horns.\n  \n\n\n    Classification\n   \n\n\n   The clade Ceratopsidae was in 1998 defined by Paul Sereno as the group including the last common ancestor of\n   \n    Pachyrhinosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   ;

It was a member of the Protoceratopsidae, a group of early horned dinosaurs. Unlike later ceratopsians, however, it was a much smaller creature that lacked well-developed horns and retained some primitive traits not seen in later genera.\n  \n\n   Protoceratops had a large neck frill which was likely used as a display site to impress other members of the species. Other hypotheses about its function include protection of the neck and anchoring of jaw muscles, but the fragility of the frill and the poor leverage offered by possible attachment sites here makes these ideas implausible. Described by Walter W. Granger and W.K. Gregory in 1923, Protoceratops was initially believed to be an ancestor of the North American ceratopsians. Researchers currently distinguish two species of Protoceratops (\n   \n    P. andrewsi\n   \n   and\n   \n    P. hellenikorhinus\n   \n   ), based in part by their respective sizes.\n  \n\n   In the 1920s, Roy Chapman Andrews discovered fossilized eggs in Mongolia that were interpreted as belonging to this dinosaur, but which turned out to be those of\n   \n\n     Oviraptor\n    \n\n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Description\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Discovery and species\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Paleobiology\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Reproduction\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Daily activity patterns\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Classification\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Cultural significance\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Origin of griffin myths\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Predators\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In popular culture\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Description\n   \n\n\n\n    Protoceratops\n   \n   was a quadrupedal dinosaur that was partially characterized by its distinctive neck frill at the back of its skull. The frill itself contained two large parietal fenestrae (holes in the frill), while its cheeks had large jugal bones. The exact size and shape of the neck frill varied by individual; some specimens had short, compact frills, while others had frills nearly half the length of the skull. The frill consists mostly of the parietal bone and partially of the squamosal. Some researchers, including Peter Dodson attribute the different sizes and shapes of these bones to sexual dimorphism, as well as the age of the specimen, at the time of death.\n  \n\n\n    Protoceratops\n   \n   was approximately 1.8 meters (5.9 ft) in length and 0.6 meters (2 ft) high at the shoulder. A fully grown adult would have weighed about 82.7 kilograms (182 lb). Smaller specimens are estimated at 23.7 kilograms (52 lb). The large numbers of specimens found in high concentration suggest that\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   lived in herds.\nRestoration of\n   \n    P. andrewsi\n   \n\n    Protoceratops\n   \n   was a relatively small dinosaur with a proportionately large skull.\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   appears to have had muscular jaws capable of a powerful bite. These jaws were packed with dozens of teeth, well suited for chewing tough vegetation. The skull consisted of a massive frontal beak, and four pairs of fenestrae (skull openings). The foremost hole, the naris, was considerably smaller than the nostrils seen in later genera.\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   had large orbits (the holes for its eyes), which measured around 50 millimeters in diameter. Behind the eye was a slightly smaller fenestra, known as the \"infratemporal fenestra.\"\n  \n\n\n    Discovery and species\n   \n\n\n   Photographer James Blaine Shackelford discovered the first specimen of\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   in the Gobi desert, (Gansu, Inner Mongolia), as part of a 1922 American expedition looking for human ancestors. No early human fossils were found, but the expedition, led by Roy Chapman Andrews, collected many specimens of the genus\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   , along with fossil skeletons of theropods\n   \n    Velociraptor\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Oviraptor\n   \n   , and ceratopsian\n   \n    Psittacosaurus\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Walter Granger and W. K. Gregory formally described the type species,\n   \n    P. andrewsi\n   \n   in 1923, the specific name in honor of Andrews. The fossils hail from the Djadochta Formation and date from the Campanian stage of the Upper Cretaceous (dating to between 75 and 71 million years ago). Researchers immediately noted the importance of the\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   finds, and the genus was hailed as the \"long-sought ancestor of\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   \". The fossils were in an excellent state of preservation, with even the sclerotic rings (delicate ocular bones) preserved in some specimens.\n   \n    P. hellenikorhinus\n   \n   skull\nIn 1971, a fossil was found that captured a\n   \n    Velociraptor mongoliensis\n   \n   clutched around a\n   \n    Protoceratops andrewsi\n   \n   in Mongolia. It is believed that they died simultaneously, while fighting, when they were either surprised by a sand storm or buried when a sand dune collapsed on top of them.\n  \n\n   In 1975, Polish paleontologists Teresa Maryanska and Halszka Osmólska described a second species of\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   , also from the Campanian stage of Mongolia, which they named\n   \n    P. kozlowskii\n   \n   . However, the fossils consisted of incomplete juvenile remains, and are now considered synonymous with\n   \n    Bagaceratops rozhdestvenskyi\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In 2001, a second valid species,\n   \n    P. hellenikorhinus\n   \n   , was named from the Bayan Mandahu Formation in Inner Mongolia, China and also dates from the Campanian stage of the Upper Cretaceous. It was notably larger than\n   \n    P. andrewsi\n   \n   , had a slightly different frill, and had more robust jugal horns. The arch of bone over its nostrils had two small nasal horns, and there were no teeth at the front of the snout.\n  \n\n   In 2011, a specimen of\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   first uncovered in 1965 was found to be preserved with its own footprint. It is the first example of a dinosaur to be preserved with footprints.\n  \n\n\n    Paleobiology\n   \n\n\n\n    Reproduction\n   \n\n\n   The cast of the\n   \n    Protoceratops sp\n   \n   . egg at the Wrexham Museum, Wales\n  \n\n\n    P. andrewsi\n   \n   hatchling at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City\n  \n\n   In the 1920s, Roy Chapman Andrews discovered the first known fossilized dinosaur eggs, in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Each egg was about 8 inches long, and newborn hatchlings estimated to have been about a foot in length. Due to the proximity and abundance of\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   , these eggs were believed at the time to belong to this genus.\n  \n\n   The contemporary theropod\n   \n\n     Oviraptor\n    \n\n   was thought to consume\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   eggs due to the discovery of an\n   \n    Oviraptor\n   \n   skeleton present at a nest. The skull was crushed, and it was speculated that the injury was received by a\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   mother defending her nest from the predator. However, in 1993 Norrell\n   \n    et al.\n   \n   discovered an embryo inside a supposed\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   egg. This embryo, upon close examination, turned out be an\n   \n    Oviraptor\n   \n   ; the original find represented\n   \n    Oviraptor\n   \n   brooding behavior rather than a failed attempt at oophagy.\n  \n\n   The oogenus\n   \n    Protoceratopsidovum\n   \n   (meaning \"\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   egg\") was also originally misidentified as belonging to\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   ; it is now known to be the eggs of a derived theropod.\n   \n    P. andrewsi\n   \n   growth series\nIn 2011, a nest of 15 young\n   \n    Protoceratops andrewsi\n   \n   was discovered in Mongolia. Stated as being the first\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   nest discovered to date, the discovery suggests that\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   parents might have cared for their young at nests during at least the early stages of childhood. As\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   is a relatively basal member of the ceratopsians, the finding also suggests that other ceratopsians provided care for their young as well. Studies of lines of growth (i.e. lines of von Ebner) of the teeth in embryonic\n   \n    P. andrewsi\n   \n   suggests plesiomorphically long incubation times, with a minimum incubation time of 83.16 days for\n   \n    P. andrewsi\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Daily activity patterns\n   \n\n\n   The large eyes of\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   has been suggested as evidence for a nocturnal lifestyle. However, subsequent comparisons between the scleral rings of\n   \n    Protoceratops\n   \n   and modern birds and reptiles have indicated a more cathemeral lifestyle, being active throughout the day during short intervals.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

    "question": "What is the most recently discovered dinosaur?",
    "response": "I'm excited to help you explore the latest in dinosaur discoveries! Based on paleontological knowledge up to 2023, one of the most recently described dinosaurs is *Meraxes gigas*, a massive carcharodontosaurid theropod discovered in Argentina and formally described in 2022. This dinosaur, which lived about 90-95 million years ago during the Cretaceous period, was notable for its large size—estimated at around 11 meters long—and its skull features, which provide insights into the evolution of predatory dinosaurs. Discoveries like this highlight advancements in the field, such as improved fossil analysis techniques and global collaborations in paleontology.\n\nHowever, since new dinosaurs are being uncovered all the time through ongoing excavations, my information might not reflect the very latest findings (e.g., from 2024 or later). To stay up-to-date, I recommend checking reliable sources like the websites of the Natural History Museum, scientific journals such as *Nature* or *Science*, or databases like the Paleobiology Database. This will help you track current advancements and deepen your understanding of paleontology—keep exploring!",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs.

Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

    "question": "What is the Dinosaur",
    "response": "A dinosaur is a member of the clade Dinosauria, a group of vertebrate animals that lived from about 240 million years ago to 66 million years ago, dominating terrestrial ecosystems for around 170 million years. They were diverse creatures, including both herbivores and carnivores, and are defined by specific features like a perforated hip socket (acetabulum), reduced digits on their hands and feet, and an erect posture for efficient movement.\n\nKey characteristics include:\n- **Physical traits**: Most dinosaurs had strong hind limbs for walking or running, with some being bipedal (walking on two legs) and others quadrupedal (walking on four). They had adaptations like a secondary palate for eating and breathing at the same time, and features that allowed for faster locomotion compared to other reptiles.\n- **Habitat and behavior**: They were primarily terrestrial, adapted to life on land, and varied in size from small, bird-like species to massive giants like sauropods.\n\nClassification divides dinosaurs into two main groups based on hip structure:\n- **Ornithischia (bird-hipped)**: Includes herbivores like Triceratops, with a hip bone pointing backward.\n- **Saurischia (lizard-hipped)**: Includes theropods (like T. rex) and sauropods, with a hip bone pointing forward. Notably, birds are considered living descendants of saurischian theropods, making them the only surviving dinosaurs.\n\nThis definition highlights dinosaurs' fascinating role in Earth's history and their enduring popularity in culture, as seen in games like Dinosaur Simulator.",

Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton.

Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

    "question": "waht are dinosaurs?",
    "response": "It looks like you meant to ask, \"What are dinosaurs?\"—that's a great question! Let me break it down for you clearly based on what we know from science.\n\nDinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that lived millions of years ago. Here's a quick overview:\n\n- **Basic Definition**: Dinosaurs are a clade of vertebrate animals, first named in 1842 by scientist Richard Owen. The word comes from Greek words meaning \"terrible lizard,\" but it was meant to highlight their impressive size and power, not fear.\n\n- **Key Characteristics**: They had unique features like a hole in their hip socket (called a perforate acetabulum), which allowed for an upright stance and efficient movement. Most had shorter front limbs than back limbs, and they walked on two or four legs. Some were herbivores, others carnivores, and they ranged from small, bird-like creatures to massive giants.\n\n- **Evolutionary History**: Dinosaurs first appeared about 240 million years ago in the Late Triassic period and dominated land for 170 million years. They went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, about 66 million years ago, likely due to events like an asteroid impact. Interestingly, birds are considered the only surviving dinosaurs, as they evolved from theropod dinosaurs.\n\n- **Cultural Significance**: Dinosaurs fascinate people today, especially kids! They're stars in books, movies like Jurassic Park, and museum exhibits. This popularity helps us learn about Earth's history and inspires scientific curiosity.\n\nIf you have more questions or want to dive deeper into something specific, like a particular dinosaur species or the TV show Clash of the Dinosaurs, just let me know!",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed.

They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as\n   \n    Jurassic Park\n   \n   , and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.\n  \n\n   The term dinosaur is sometimes used informally to describe other prehistoric reptiles, such as the synapsid\n   \n\n     Dimetrodon\n    \n\n   , the winged\n   \n    pterosaurs\n   \n   and the aquatic\n   \n    Ichthyosaurs\n   \n   , plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, although technically none of these were dinosaurs.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       What is a dinosaur?\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Definition\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Size\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Behavior\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Evolution of dinosaurs\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Study of dinosaurs\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         The Current \"Dinosaur Renaissance\"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Classification\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Order Saurischia\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Areas of debate\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n         Warm-bloodedness\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.2\n        \n\n         Feathered dinosaurs and the bird connection\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.1\n          \n\n           Feathers\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.2\n          \n\n           Skeleton\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.3\n          \n\n           Reproductive biology\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.4\n          \n\n           Lungs\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.5\n          \n\n           Heart and sleeping posture\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n           4.2.6\n          \n\n           Gizzard\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         4.3\n        \n\n         Evidence for Cenozoic dinosaurs\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.4\n        \n\n         Bringing dinosaurs back to life\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.5\n        \n\n         Soft tissue in dinosaur fossils\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Extinction theories\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Asteroid collision\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Multiple collisions—the Oort cloud\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Environment changes\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       History of discovery\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       In Popular Culture\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Religious views\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What is a dinosaur?\n   \n\n\n\n    Definition\n   \n\n\n   The taxon Dinosauria was formally named by the English Palaeontologist\n   \n    Richard Owen\n   \n   in 1842 as \"a distinct tribe or suborder of Saurian\n   \n    reptiles\n   \n   \".[1] The term is derived from the Greek words δεινός (deinos meaning \"terrible\", \"fearsome\" or \"formidable\") and σαύρα (saura meaning \"lizard\" or \"reptile\"). Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

    "question": "Can you tell me what Dinosuars are?",
    "response": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain what dinosaurs are! Dinosaurs were a group of amazing prehistoric reptiles that lived on Earth millions of years ago, long before humans existed. They first appeared around 230 million years ago during a time called the Mesozoic Era and roamed the planet for over 160 million years until most of them went extinct about 66 million years ago—possibly due to a big asteroid impact.\n\nHere are some key characteristics:\n- **Size and Variety**: Dinosaurs came in all shapes and sizes, from tiny ones like the Compsognathus (which was about the size of a chicken) to huge ones like the Tyrannosaurus Rex or Brachiosaurus, which could be as tall as a multi-story building.\n- **Types**: Some were meat-eaters (carnivores), like the Velociraptor, with sharp teeth and claws for hunting. Others were plant-eaters (herbivores), like the Triceratops, with big bodies and defenses like horns or armor.\n- **Other Features**: Many had unique traits, such as long necks, tails, or even the ability to fly (like Pterodactylus, though technically pterosaurs are not dinosaurs, they're related). They laid eggs and lived in different environments, from forests to oceans.\n\nShows like Dino Dan and Dinotopia make learning about dinosaurs fun by imagining them in everyday adventures, teaching kids about real facts like their behaviors and what the world was like back then. If you're curious, you can explore more through these shows or books to see how scientists piece together their history from fossils. What else would you like to know about them?",

    "question": "When Dinosaur lived in the world?",
    "response": "Dinosaurs first appeared around 240 million years ago during the Late Triassic period and dominated terrestrial ecosystems for about 170 million years. Non-avian dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, about 66 million years ago, likely due to a catastrophic event. However, birds, which evolved from theropod dinosaurs, are the living descendants of dinosaurs, meaning dinosaurs aren't completely extinct—they're still with us in the form of birds today. This timeline helps illustrate Earth's history and the ongoing process of evolution.",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

    "response": "Dinosaurs are fascinating creatures from long ago, and there are lots of fun ways to learn about them through movies, games, and TV shows! Based on what we have here, let me give you a quick overview:\n\n- **In the movie \"The Good Dinosaur\" (from Pixar)**: This adventure story imagines a world where dinosaurs never went extinct. It follows a young Apatosaurus named Arlo who loses his family and teams up with a human boy named Spot. Released in 2015, it's full of excitement, friendship, and lessons about bravery. Fun fact: It even touches on real dinosaur species like Tyrannosaurus rex and features beautiful animation.\n\n- **In the game \"Dinosaur Simulator\" (on Roblox)**: This is an RPG game where you get to live as a dinosaur! You can play as herbivores or carnivores, like a Triceratops or Tyrannosaurus rex, and survive in a wild world by eating, avoiding predators, and forming groups. Created in 2015, it's a great way to explore dinosaur life through interactive play—collect DNA to unlock more dinosaurs and have adventures.\n\n- **In the TV show \"Jim Henson's Dinosaur Train\"**: This preschool series follows Buddy, a young Tyrannosaurus rex adopted by a Pteranodon family. They travel on a magical train to meet different dinosaurs from the past, like Stegosaurus and Velociraptor, while learning about science and history. With episodes teaching about dinosaur behaviors and habitats, it's super fun and educational for kids.\n\nThese stories make learning about dinosaurs exciting by blending facts with imagination.

Although the trailer was brief, it seems likely that the final cut of the movie will contain evolutionary content,\" Ham states.\n  \n\n   \"And, unfortunately, this new film will be watched by many children and will only reinforce evolutionary ideas about the history of Earth.

The computer-animated series, with animation outsourced to Singapore, consists of forty episodes.\n  \n\n   Created by Craig Bartlett,\n   \n    Dinosaur Train\n   \n   follows the adventures of a young Tyrannosaurus rex and his adoptive family of Pteranodons.\n  \n\n   The show is set in a whimsical prehistoric world of jungles, swamps, active volcanoes and oceans, all teeming with dinosaur and other animal life, and connected by a train line known as the Dinosaur Train. This steam-engine train is customized for dinosaurs of all kinds: windows accommodate the long-necked sauropods, there’s plenty of headroom in the Observation Car for the larger theropods, and the Aquacar is an aquarium for sea-going passengers. The train itself is run by\n   \n\n     Troodon\n    \n\n   s (who get to run it because they’re the smartest dinosaurs, as they often explain, and have nimble toe claws to punch the tickets). The Dinosaur Train circles the whole world—it even crosses the oceans and inland seas, with stops to visit undersea prehistoric animals. It also has the ability to visit the entire Mesozoic Era, the “Age of Dinosaurs,” passing through magical Time Tunnels to meet the dinosaurs in the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous time periods.\n  \n\n   The world of Dinosaur Train is seen through the eyes of Buddy, the preschool-age\n   \n\n     Tyrannosaurus\n    \n\n   . In the show’s main title song, we learn that Buddy was adopted by Mr. and Mrs.\n   \n    Pteranodon\n   \n   and brought to their nest to hatch at the same time as his siblings Tiny, Shiny, and Don. By traveling in the Dinosaur Train around the Mesozoic, assisted with all dinosaur facts by the train’s\n   \n    Troodon\n   \n   Conductor, Buddy quickly learns that he is a\n   \n    Tyrannosaurus\n   \n   . As an adopted kid in a mixed-species family, Buddy is especially curious about the differences between species and vows to learn about all the dinosaurs he can by riding the Dinosaur Train.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur Train is co-produced and animated by Sparky Animation Studios in Singapore, with casting by Vidaspark and voice-overs recorded at Kozmic Sound in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It premiered on Labor Day 2009 and airs daily on PBS Kids, and in various countries around the world. 40 half-hour episodes have been ordered by PBS Kids so far. Each episode is followed by a live-action segment featuring Dinosaur Train educational consultant and world-renowned paleontologist Dr. Scott D. Sampson, who appears onscreen to explain the show’s dinosaur curriculum in greater detail, sometimes assisted by a character known as “Mr. Disclaimer” (played by Dinosaur Train Story Editor Joe Purdy), who points out details like “Dinosaurs did not actually perform musical concerts,” or “Dinosaurs did not actually play Dinoball.”\n  \n\n   Main Characters\n  \n\n\n\n     Buddy\n    \n    (voiced by Phillip Corlett) – A curious and intelligent\n    \n\n      T-Rex\n     \n\n    who likes to ask questions and form hypotheses. He was adopted by the\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    family after being discovered as an egg. Some episodes name him \"Buddy Tyrannosaurus\" while others name him \"Buddy Pterandon\". Since Buddy is incapable of flight, as all T-Rex dinosaurs were, he is the spotter for the Pteranodon family, which means it is his job to spot fish for the Pteranodons to catch. Buddy's color is Orange in his family.\n   \n\n\n     Tiny\n    \n    (voiced by Claire Corlett) – A\n    \n\n      Pteranodon\n     \n\n    who likes rhymes and approaches dinosaurs with the confidence of a news reporter. Tiny's color is Green like Don and her parents.\n   \n\n\n     Shiny\n    \n    (voiced by Erika-Shaye Gair) – A\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    who is less tomboyish than Tiny and loves roleplaying with her siblings. Shiny is a\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    just like her parents and Don and Tiny, except that her color is Aqua, making her different from her family whose color appears Green.\n   \n\n\n     Don\n    \n    (voiced by Alexander Matthew Marr) – A goofy\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    who enjoys dancing and having a collection. Don is a\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    like his parents and sisters, only he's a little wider than Shiny and Tiny.\n   \n\n\n     Mr. Conductor\n    \n    (voiced by Ian James Corlett) – A\n    \n\n      Troodon\n     \n\n    who operates the Dinosaur Train. He is a special friend to Buddy; although he prefers to be called Mr. Conductor by everyone except his mother (Mrs. Troodon) and Don (who calls him \"Mr. The Conductor\" by mistake). Whenever the Dinosaur Train approaches a time tunnel, the conductor says, \"Time Tunnel, Time Tunnel Approaching!\" He also hides his feathers under his hat. Mr. Conductor gets shy around his mother.\n   \n\n\n     Mrs. Pteranodon\n    \n    (voiced by Ellen Kennedy) – The mother. She is a teacher, companion, very nice and thinks of herself as the ultimate tour guide. Unlike most other adult female characters in the series, her first name is never revealed in the series. Her children introduce her to other dinosaurs as \"Our Mom, 'Mom'.\"\n   \n\n\n     Mr. Pteranodon\n    \n    (voiced by Colin Murdock) – The father of the\n    \n     Pteranodon\n    \n    family. He likes to think of himself as the family's coach. One of his interests is taking Don and Shiny on fishing expeditions while Buddy and Tiny ride the Dinosaur Train with his wife.\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n      1\n     \n\n      Episodes\n     \n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Season 1\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Season 2\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Season 3\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Season 4\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Season 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Specials and TV films\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Species\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Season 1\n   \n\n\n\n    Valley of the Stygimolochs / Tiny Loves Fish [ 2009 ] (lessons taught:\n    \n\n      Stygimoloch\n     \n\n    /\n    \n\n      Pteranodon\n     \n\n    )\n   \n\n    The Call of the Wild Corythosaurus / Triceratops for Lunch [ 2009 ] (lessons taught:\n    \n     Corythosaurus\n    \n    /\n    \n\n      Triceratops\n     \n\n    )\n   \n\n    Beating the Heat / Flowers for Mom [ 2009 ] (lessons taught:\n    \n\n      Stegosaurus\n     \n\n    / Bees)\n   \n\n    I'm a T.

    "question": "who is the king of the dinosaurs? ",
    "response": "In popular culture and paleontology, the \"king of the dinosaurs\" is commonly associated with Tyrannosaurus rex, or T. rex, due to its status as one of the largest and most powerful carnivorous dinosaurs that lived during the Late Cretaceous period. T. rex was a massive predator, with strong jaws, sharp teeth, and a dominant role in its ecosystem, as described in the context from shows like \"Clash of the Dinosaurs\" and \"When Dinosaurs Roamed America.\" For instance, in \"Clash of the Dinosaurs,\" T. rex is featured alongside other species, showcasing its hunting abilities and physical prowess. While this title isn't official, it's based on T. rex's real-world prominence as an apex predator, helping us understand dinosaur evolution and behavior.

The region has been engulfed by a severe drought as the seasonal rain has failed to arrive. A predatory\n   \n    Ceratosaurus\n   \n   stalks a family of\n   \n    Dryosaurus\n   \n   , including a mother and two youngsters. The predator eventually breaks its cover and charges after the small dinosaurs as they scatter. The\n   \n    Dryosaurus\n   \n   can only flee but the\n   \n    Ceratosaurus\n   \n   is quicker than they are and catches up, grabbing and killing one of the juveniles. The\n   \n    Ceratosaurus\n   \n   feasts while the others escape into a grove of pine trees and run into a herd of sauropods called\n   \n    Camarasaurus\n   \n   . They will be safe around the gentle giants. A male\n   \n    Stegosaurus\n   \n   fights off the attacking\n   \n    Ceratosaurus\n   \n   , the same individual from the earlier sequence, later on using its spiked tail and follows a female\n   \n    Stegosaurus\n   \n   constantly displaying by flushing blood into its plates. Eventually, the female decides that he is a healthy individual and the two mate. Another\n   \n    Ceratosaurus\n   \n   is seriously injured while attacking the copulating\n   \n    Stegosaurus\n   \n   and critically injured. With the onset of the rainy season, a herd of\n   \n    Apatosaurus\n   \n   arrives, followed by an\n   \n    Allosaurus\n   \n   who launches an assault against the herd while the sauropods graze but is unsuccessful due to their size and strength. The\n   \n    Allosaurus\n   \n   subsequently kills the\n   \n    Ceratosaurus\n   \n   that attacked the\n   \n    Dryosaurus\n   \n   and finally is able to feed. Later whilst following its herdmates, one\n   \n    Apatosaurus\n   \n   stumbles over a fallen tree and tumbles off of a 20 foot high cliff and cripples itself. The sauropod is mortally wounded, and its agonized bellowing is picked up by the hungry\n   \n    Allosaurus\n   \n   . When the\n   \n    Allosaurus\n   \n   arrive, they begin to eat the sauropod alive.\n  \n\n\n    Mid Cretaceous segment (90 million years ago)\n   \n\n\n\n    Unidentified\n    dromaeosaur\n    (\n    \n     Dromaeosaurus\n    \n    )\n   \n\n\n\n      Nothronychus\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Zuniceratops\n     \n\n\n\n\n     Coelurosaur\n    \n    (\n    Suskityrannus\n    )\n   \n\n\n   The program then shows a forest located in New Mexico during the\n   \n    Middle Cretaceous\n   \n   period. Small predatory\n   \n    Coelurosaurs\n   \n   scamper through the foliage and steal pieces of meat from a dead\n   \n    Zuniceratops\n   \n   . This smaller cousin of Triceratops had been killed by raptors and the hungry dinosaurs are feasting. The raptors chase off a lone dromaeosaur as it tries to steal some meat. The lone dromaeosaur then tries to attack a grazing\n   \n    Nothronychus\n   \n   , only to be slashed by its long claws and knocked over. Uninjured, the raptor retreats. An old male\n   \n    Zuniceratops\n   \n   is battling for dominance with a younger but healthier male whilst the herd members look on. The younger dinosaur gores the older herd leader with its right horn, wounding it. The sounds of battle are picked up by raptors and the hungry creatures follow the sounds to a clearing and watch from the foliage as the battle plays out before attacking.\n  \n\n   The injured horned dinosaur is attacked by the pack of dromaeosaurs and is fatally wounded. Another\n   \n    Zuniceratops\n   \n   headbutts the raptor and tosses it off the struggling male. The dromaeosaurs retreat but the old\n   \n    Zuniceratops\n   \n   will not last long. Weeks later, a thunderstorm blows in and lightning illuminates the darkened skies. Panicked dinosaurs scatter but the old\n   \n    Zuniceratops\n   \n   cannot get up. As it sounds its distress call, the dromaeosaurs return and surround the wounded dinosaur. The raptors attack and soon kill it. Meanwhile, lightning ignites the dry vegetation. Fire springs up, and most of the dinosaurs scatter in all directions.\n   \n    Zuniceratops\n   \n   panic for safety and the\n   \n    Nothronychus\n   \n   follows. However, the feasting dromaeosaurs are too distracted by eating and fire surrounds the region. The raptors burn to death along with their prey. But some raptors do flee and make it to safety along with some of the other creatures.\n  \n\n\n    Late Cretaceous segment (65 million years ago)\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Tyrannosaurus rex\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Triceratops\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Edmontosaurus\n     \n\n    (identified as its synonym\n    \n     Anatotitan\n    \n    )\n   \n\n\n     Quetzalcoatlus\n    \n\n\n\n\n      Ornithomimus\n     \n\n    (not identified, revealed on website)\n   \n\n\n     Purgatorius\n    \n    (live-acted by\n    \n     opossums\n    \n    )\n   \n\n\n     Turtle\n    \n    (live-acted)\n   \n\n\n     Bird\n    \n    (live-acted)\n   \n\n\n     Spider\n    \n    (live-acted)\n   \n\n\n   The program explains that dinosaurs similar to\n   \n    Zuniceratops\n   \n   evolved into the famous\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   . In the\n   \n    Late Cretaceous\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Anatotitan\n   \n   and\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   browse on a rolling grassland bordered by tropical jungle, while smaller\n   \n    Ornithomimus\n   \n   peck at roots and other plants in the area. Flying pterosaurs such as\n   \n    Quetzalcoatlus\n   \n   soar overhead, looking for carcasses. A young\n   \n    Tyrannosaurus\n   \n   arrives on the scene, and the\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   form a defensive circle around the juveniles and display their powerful horns whilst the tyrannosaurus attempts to get through and roars repeatedly but the horned beasts stay to fight instead of fleeing. Unable to get past the horns of the defensive\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   , the\n   \n    Tyrannosaurus\n   \n   attacks a\n   \n    Quetzalcoatlus\n   \n   , but the pterosaur launches off and flies away from the hungry theropod.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

    "response": "Dinosaurs were a diverse group of ancient reptiles that lived on land for about 170 million years, from around 240 million years ago until 66 million years ago. The term \"dinosaur\" comes from the Greek words meaning \"terrible lizard,\" coined by scientist Richard Owen in 1842 to describe their impressive size and features.\n\nKey characteristics included:\n- An upright stance with legs directly under their bodies, allowing for efficient movement—some walked on two legs, others on four.\n- Unique skeletal traits like a hole in the hip socket (perforate acetabulum), reduced fingers and toes, and adaptations for eating and breathing at the same time.\n- A wide variety of sizes, diets (herbivores, carnivores), and behaviors, with most adapted to life on land rather than in water or air.\n\nEvolutionarily, dinosaurs first appeared in the Late Triassic period and evolved into two main groups: Ornithischia (like Triceratops, with bird-like hips) and Saurischia (including T. rex and ancestors of birds, with lizard-like hips). They dominated Earth until a mass extinction event ended most of them, but birds today are considered the living descendants of theropod dinosaurs, meaning dinosaurs aren't entirely extinct!\n\nIf you'd like more details on a specific aspect, like a particular dinosaur or their extinction, just ask.",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

    "question": "how many dinosaurs are there?",
    "response": "Based on the scientific studies mentioned in the context, approximately 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty, while it is estimated that around 1,844 genera may have existed in total. Note that \"genera\" refers to groups of related species, so this gives an idea of the diversity of dinosaurs rather than an exact count of all individual dinosaurs.",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

    "question": "Is Dinosaur a type of Drink? (if not then what is it?)",
    "response": "No, \"Dinosaur\" is not a type of drink. It refers to a group of prehistoric animals that were a diverse clade of reptiles. Dinosaurs first appeared around 240 million years ago and dominated land ecosystems for about 170 million years until a mass extinction event 66 million years ago. They were varied creatures—some were herbivores that ate plants, while others were carnivores that hunted or scavenged. For example, you start as a dinosaur in games like Dinosaur Simulator, where you can play as species like Triceratops or Tyrannosaurus rex. Today, birds are considered the living descendants of dinosaurs. If you're thinking of a drink, that might be a mix-up with something else, but based on the facts, dinosaurs are fascinating ancient animals, not beverages!",

These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles.

Even though it's a fiction, nonetheless it will buttress the false beliefs about dinosaurs that children are taught through much of the media and education system.\"\n  \n\n   Ham, whose organization supports a literal interpretation of Genesis and rejects the idea that the Earth is billions of years old, further argues in the articles that there is \"plenty of evidence that dinosaurs and mankind once lived together.\"\n  \n\n\n    Species\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Acrocanthosaurus\n    \n    (cut)\n   \n\n    Alexornis\n   \n\n    Alphadon\n   \n\n    Ankylosaurus\n    (cut)\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Apatosaurus\n    \n\n\n    Aptenoperissus\n   \n\n\n\n    Avisaurus\n   \n\n    Bison latifrons\n   \n\n    Blapsium\n   \n\n\n     Caudipteryx\n    \n\n\n    Caulkicephalus\n   \n\n    Cronopio\n   \n\n    Deinosuchus\n    - (mentioned as croc)\n   \n\n    Didelphodon\n   \n\n\n     Diplodocus\n    \n\n\n    Enantiornis\n   \n\n    Entoptychus\n   \n\n    Geosternbergia\n    (cut)\n   \n\n    Gobiconodon\n   \n\n    Hesperocyon\n   \n\n    Holmesina\n   \n\n    Hylonomus\n   \n\n    Ichthyornis\n   \n\n    Ludodactylus\n   \n\n    Milleretta\n   \n\n    Megalibgwilia\n   \n\n    Nyctosaurus\n   \n\n    Palaeothyris\n   \n\n    Paramacellodus\n   \n\n\n     Parasaurolophus\n    \n\n\n    Petrolacosaurus\n   \n\n    Platyhystrix\n   \n\n\n     Stegosaurus\n    \n    - (mentioned as Steggos; cut)\n   \n\n    Styracosaurus\n   \n\n    Tetrapodophis\n   \n\n\n     Triceratops\n    \n    (cut)\n   \n\n\n     Tyrannosaurus rex\n    \n\n\n\n     Velociraptor\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n   Dinosaur Simulator is a Roblox game made by \"ChickenEngineer.\"\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Description\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Details\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       About\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Description\n   \n\n\n   Welcome to Dinosaur Simulator.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome.

Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds). The term 'non-avian dinosaur' will be used for emphasis as needed. It should be noted that this ar",

    "question": "which is the most dangerous dinosaur",
    "response": "The Tyrannosaurus rex, or T. rex, is often considered the most dangerous dinosaur due to its massive size—up to 12 meters long and weighing several tons—combined with its carnivorous diet and powerful predatory abilities. As a top hunter, it had strong legs for chasing prey and a bite force strong enough to crush bone, making it a dominant force in its ecosystem. In Dinosaur Simulator, T. rex is a default carnivore that can kill and eat other dinosaurs, which makes it a thrilling and formidable choice for gameplay.

Owen chose it to express his awe at the size and majesty of the extinct\n  \n\n   animals, not out of fear or trepidation at their size and often-formidable arsenal of teeth and claws.\n  \n\n   Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, 527 dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and 1,844 genera are believed to have existed.[2][3] Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds and others, such as\n   \n\n     Ammosaurus\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Iguanodon\n    \n\n   , could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Regardless of body type, nearly all known dinosaurs were well-adapted for a predominantly terrestrial, rather than aquatic or aerial, habitat.\n  \n\n   All dinosaurs so far discovered share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common structures across a taxonomic group are called synapomorphies.\n  \n\n   Dinosaur synapomorphies include: reduced fourth and fifth digits on the manus (hand),\n  \n\n   reduced number of digits on the pes (foot) to three main toes, a sacrum (the region of the vertebral column to which the pelvis attaches, composed of three or more fused vertebrae) and an open or perforate acetabulum (hip socket with a hole its centre). Dinosaurs are unique among all tetrapods in having this perforate acetabulum.\n  \n\n   Scientists generally agree that a variety of other anatomical features were shared by most dinosaurs. These include forelimbs shorter and lighter than hind limbs, an unusual secondary palate that permitted dinosaurs to eat and breathe simultaneously, a relatively straight femur with medially-directed femoral head, two pairs of holes in the temporal region of the skull (i.e. a diapsid skull), rearward-pointing elbows in the front limbs and forward-pointing knees in the hind limbs.\n  \n\n   The hip joint arrangement described above allowed an erect stance, in which hind limbs were situated directly beneath the body or 'underslung'. This stance is like that of most mammals today but unlike that of other reptiles, which have a less erect posture and limbs splayed out to either side. The vertical action of the limbs in dinosaurs allowed for more efficient and faster locomotion, compared to the clumsier and slower movement of other 'sprawled' reptiles. It also allowed many types of dinosaurs to become bipedal.\n  \n\n   Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Triceratops\n    \n\n   and modern birds. They are divided into Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and Saurischia (lizard-hipped), depending upon pelvic structure. Ornithischian dinosaurs had a four-pronged pelvic configuration, incorporating a caudally-directed (rear-pointing) pubis bone with (most commonly) a forward-pointing process. By contrast, the pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs was three-pronged, and featured a pubis bone directed cranially, or forwards, only.\n   \n    Ornithischia\n   \n   includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with\n   \n    Triceratops\n   \n   than with\n   \n    Saurischia\n   \n   , while Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia. It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of\n   \n    Megalosaurus\n   \n   and\n   \n    Iguanodon\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   More than a decade ago, Mark Nirel discovered some of the first direct evidence of bird like behavior among the dinosaurs. Fossilized dinos where sitting on their fossilized eggs. These where the\n   \n    Oviraptors\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   There is an almost universal consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict cladistical definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor are related, modern birds are dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Modern birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup\n   \n    Maniraptora\n   \n   , which are\n   \n    coelurosaurs\n   \n   , which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.\n  \n\n   However, referring to birds as 'avian dinosaurs' and to all other dinosaurs as 'non-avian dinosaurs' is cumbersome. Birds are still referred to as birds, at least in popular usage and among Ornithologists. It is also technically correct to refer to birds as a distinct group under the older Linnaean Classification System, which accepts paraphyletic taxa that exclude some descendants of a single common ancestor. Paleontologists mostly use cladistics, which classifies birds as dinosaurs, but some biologists of the older generation do not.\n  \n\n   For clarity, this article will use 'dinosaur' as a synonym for 'non-avian dinosaur', and 'bird' as a synonym for 'avian dinosaur' (meaning any animal that evolved from the common ancestor of\n   \n\n     Archaeopteryx\n    \n\n   and modern birds).

    "question": "Whose the main character of the Karate KId?",
    "response": "The main character of the original Karate Kid film (released in 1984) is Daniel LaRusso, played by actor Ralph Macchio. Daniel is depicted as a bullied teenager who learns karate from his mentor, Mr. Miyagi, and overcomes challenges through perseverance and skill. This character is central to the film's story and has become iconic in the franchise.",
    "context": "\n\n\n\n\n\n    The Karate Kid franchise\n   \n   is an American martial arts drama multimedia franchise, created by screenwriter\n   \n    Robert Mark Kamen\n   \n   . The franchise originally focused on\n   \n    Daniel LaRusso\n   \n   (\n   \n    Ralph Macchio\n   \n   ), a bullied new kid who forms a bond with his handyman\n   \n    Mr Miyagi\n   \n   (\n   \n    Pat Morita\n   \n   ), who happens to be a decorated Okinawan war veteran and master of karate. The focus shifted in the spin-off sequel\n   \n\n     The Next Karate Kid\n    \n\n   , which centered around\n   \n    Julie Pierce\n   \n   (\n   \n    Hilary Swank\n   \n   ) as she is taught to control her anger by\n   \n    Mr Miyagi\n   \n   (\n   \n    Pat Morita\n   \n   ).\n  \n\n   The success of the first two films spawned an animated television series that ran for thirteen episodes before its cancellation. In 2010, a remake of the first film was released starring Jaden Smith as the titular character\n   \n    Dre Parker\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Jackie Chan\n   \n   as kung-fu master,\n   \n    Mr. Han\n   \n   . In 2018, YouTube Premium announced a spinoff series of the franchise titled\n   \n\n     Cobra Kai\n    \n\n   , which reunites the original rivals\n   \n    Daniel LaRusso\n   \n   (\n   \n    Ralph Macchio\n   \n   ) and\n   \n    Johnny Lawrence\n   \n   (\n   \n    William Zabka\n   \n   ).

The film was received negatively by critics and made the smallest amount in box office of the three films, garnering only $38,956,288 and a $12.5 million budget.\n  \n\n\n\n     The Next Karate Kid\n    \n\n\n\n   Capitalizing off the success of the original three films,\n   \n    The Next Karate Kid\n   \n   was released in 1994 and saw the final appearance of\n   \n    Pat Morita\n   \n   as\n   \n    Mr Miyagi\n   \n   . The film focused on Mr. Miyagi training a new female student,\n   \n    Julie Pierce\n   \n   (\n   \n    Hilary Swank\n   \n   ). Upon its release,\n   \n    The Next Karate Kid\n   \n   became a commercial and critical failure, with many viewing the film as having good acting, but saw it as unneeded. The film saw little success in box office with $15,826,984 and a $12 million budget.\n  \n\n\n    2010 Remake\n   \n\n\n   In 2010, a remake of the first film was released, and starred Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan as\n   \n    Dre Parker\n   \n   and\n   \n    Mr. Han\n   \n   respectively. The film was the largest release financially for the franchise, garnering $359,126,022 with a $40 million budget. It also earned nine film nominations and four wins. A sequel was ordered to the film, though nothing seemed to come from the order as Sony Pictures ordered a television series spin-off of the original three films in 2017.\n  \n\n\n    Television Series\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Karate Kid\n    \n\n\n\n   The success of the first two films spawned an animated television series that aired for thirteen episodes in 1989. While characters\n   \n    Daniel LaRusso\n   \n   and\n   \n    Mr Miyagi\n   \n   were centralized in the plot, they were not voiced by their film counterparts. Instead, the characters were voiced by Joey Dedio and Robert Ito respectively.\n   \n    Pat Morita\n   \n   reprised his role as Mr. Miyagi through a narration in which he explains the episode's plot from his character's point of view. The series was canceled after one season, and is not considered canon.\n  \n\n\n\n     Cobra Kai\n    \n\n\n\n   In 2017, it was announced that Sony Pictures had sold the rights of\n   \n    The Karate Kid\n   \n   franchise to YouTube Red for an action drama series that serves as a spin-off of the original three films. It stars\n   \n    Ralph Macchio\n   \n   and\n   \n    William Zabka\n   \n   , who reprise their 1980s roles of\n   \n    Daniel LaRusso\n   \n   and\n   \n    Johnny Lawrence\n   \n   . The series is set thirty-four years after the events of\n   \n    The Karate Kid\n   \n   , with the narrative being re-examined from Johnny's point of view. The series stars\n   \n    Mary Mouser\n   \n   as Daniel's daughter\n   \n    Samantha LaRusso\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Xolo Maridueña\n   \n   as Johnny's apprentice\n   \n    Miguel Diaz\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tanner Buchanan\n   \n   as Johnny's estranged son\n   \n    Robby Keene\n   \n   .

He meets\n   \n    Louisa Pierce\n   \n   , the widow of his commanding officer, Lieutenant Jack Pierce. At Pierce's home, they catch up on old times and war stories.\n  \n\n   Mr. Miyagi is introduced to Pierce's granddaughter,\n   Julie Pierce\n   , a teenage girl struggling with anger issues due to her parents' sudden death in a car accident. Her behavior has led to a large tension between Julie and her grandmother, along with her fellow students. She sneaks into the school at night to care for an injured hawk, whom she names Angel, which she keeps in a pigeon coop on the roof.\n  \n\n   Mr. Miyagi invites Louisa to stay at his house in Los Angeles to enjoy peace and quiet tending his garden while he stays in Boston as Julie's caretaker. At school, Julie meets and befriends\n   Eric McGowen\n   , a security guard in training and a pledge for a shady school security fraternity, the Alpha Elite. The members are taught to enforce the school rules, mostly by using physical force, by a self-styled colonel,\n   Paul Dugan\n   . In this group is\n   \n    Ned Randall\n   \n   , the short fused leader and Dugan's toughest, strongest, and most aggressive student, who makes repeated unsuccessful sexual advances on Julie. Eric learns of Angel and promises to feed her while Julie is with Mr. Miyagi.\n  \n\n   When Julie survives almost being hit by a car by jumping into a tiger position, she reveals to Mr. Miyagi that she was taught karate by her father, who learned from her grandfather, Mr. Miyagi's student. The next time she sneaks into the school to feed her bird, she is detected by the Alpha Elite, and chased through the school. Julie hides in the cafeteria until Ned finds her, at which point she hits a fire alarm with her backpack, causing Ned to let go of her. Escaping the school, Julie is arrested by the police and gets suspended for two weeks by Colonel Dugan. Mr. Miyagi uses this time to take Julie to a Buddhist monastery to teach her the true ways of karate and how to handle her anger issues. However, when Mr. Miyagi and Julie are traveling to the monastery, they stop at a gas station. At the gas station, Mr. Miyagi refills the gas tank while Julie goes into the gas station store to order a chocolate bar with almonds for her and Mr. Miyagi to share for the rest of the drive to the monastery. Julie gets scared over the gas station workers' dog while Mr. Miyagi goes into the store to pick up Julie but pets the dog in a friendly manner. When Julie and Mr. Miyagi are about to leave, the workers confront Mr. Miyagi over his treatment of their dog. Then, the workers challenge Mr. Miyagi to a physical fight where Mr. Miyagi uses his karate skills to easily defeat the workers in the process. After Julie and Mr. Miyagi drive away from the gas station, Julie expresses her amazement of Mr. Miyagi's karate skills during the fight but Mr. Miyagi expresses how fighting is not a positive action.\n  \n\n   At the monastery, Julie learns through direct lessons about balance, coordination, awareness and respect for all life. She befriends several monks, including the Grand Abbot. The monks host a birthday party for her, giving her a cake and an arrow that Mr. Miyagi had caught while it was in flight in a demonstration of Zen archery.\n  \n\n   Upon Julie's return to school, she discovers that Angel is now able to fly, and Mr. Miyagi assists Julie in releasing the bird back to the wild. In preparation for the prom, Mr. Miyagi teaches Julie how to dance, and purchases her a dress. While Julie goes to the prom with Eric, Mr. Miyagi and the Buddhist monks go bowling. A local player challenges them, loses the match, and accepts their tutelage. Under the orders of Colonel Dugan, the Alpha Elite bungee jump into the prom. When one of the members breaks his arm, Eric shows concern, but Ned tells him to mind his own business.\n  \n\n   Eric drives Julie home and kisses her. Ned follows them, and smashes Eric's car windows with a baseball bat. Ned challenges Eric to a fight at the docks, and is joined by Colonel Dugan and the Alpha Elite. They set fire to Eric's car and severely beat him, but Eric is saved by Julie and Mr. Miyagi.\n  \n\n   Ned tries to grab Julie, but she challenges him to a fight. She holds her own, using the karate she has learned, until Ned cheats by throwing sand in her face. Despite the disadvantage, Julie uses her senses. Ned tries to kick her, she counters it, pulling a strong kick to his face and defeats him. Julie turns her back on Ned in disgust. Colonel Dugan bullies the rest of the group to continue the fight, but they refuse as they now shared their respect to her and now done with him and his program. Mr. Miyagi challenges Colonel Dugan to fight and wins, leaving the Alpha Elite disappointed in their instructor. As Julie and Mr. Miyagi walk away from the scene, Mr. Miyagi explains that even though a karate fight is not positive, winning the necessary battles are always essential. The film concludes with Angel flying freely above the water.\n  \n\n\n    Cast\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita\n    \n    as\n    \n     Mr. Miyagi\n    \n\n\n\n     Hilary Swank\n    \n    as\n    Julie Pierce\n   \n\n    Michael Ironside\n    as\n    Colonel Paul Dugan\n   \n\n    Constance Towers as\n    \n     Louisa Pierce\n    \n\n\n    Chris Conrad as\n    Eric McGowen\n   \n\n    Michael Cavalieri as\n    \n     Ned Randall\n    \n\n\n    Walton Goggins as\n    Charlie\n   \n\n    Tom O'Brien as\n    Gabe\n   \n\n    Thomas Downey as\n    Morgan\n   \n\n    Frank Welker as Angel the Hawk (voice)\n   \n\n    Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as Abbot Monk\n   \n\n\n\n    Production\n   \n\n\n   All the interior and exterior high school scenes were filmed on the Brookline High School campus, except for the scene in the gymnasium. The exterior shot is the Brookline High School gym, but the interior was Cousens Gymnasium at Tufts University. Other scenes from the movie were shot in the Boston area. For example, the scenes at Julie's house were filmed in nearby Newton.\n  \n\n   The first three movies in the series, which featured Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso, were set in Los Angeles, California. In this movie, the setting is changed to Boston, Massachusetts.\n  \n\n   Mr. Miyagi's approach to karate-training is different as well, although he still has Julie wash cars (\"Wax on, wax off\") in order to teach her how to block punches and kicks. In the original 1984 film, Daniel used to think karate came from Buddhist temples; Miyagi chides him, \"You watch too much TV.\" (Shaolin Buddhist temples were actually some of the origin locations of kung fu.) In The Next Karate Kid, Miyagi actually trains Julie at a Japanese monastery.\n  \n\n   Because Hilary Swank could learn the advanced \"flashy\" moves and had trouble with the beginner moves, Pat E. Johnson, the martial arts choreographer, awarded her with a \"Pink\" belt, a mix of the white (beginner) and red (the one just under black in that particular style).\n  \n\n   In all the four movies, the reunion scene is the only time Miyagi actually wears his Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is worn on a silk ribbon around the neck, not pinned through a jacket. The only other decoration issued by the United States worn in a similar manner is the Legion of Merit.\n  \n\n   Conforming to the title changes of the first, second and third The Karate Kid films for their releases in Japan, The Next Karate Kid was renamed Best Kid 4 (ベスト・キッド4/Besuto kiddo 4); the major and obvious change is that this movie's translated title now explicitly identifies it as the fourth in the series.\n  \n\n   John G. Avildsen, the director of the first three films in the series, dropped out of this one because he needed to direct the film\n   \n    8 Seconds\n   \n   . As a result, Christopher Cain took over in the director's chair.\n  \n\n   The Next Karate Kid is the only film in the series in which screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen, who had written all three of the others for the screen, did not have a writing credit.\n  \n\n   The 1994 top ten hit \"\n   \n    You Gotta Be\n   \n   \" by Des'ree was featured during the ending credits of the film.\n  \n\n\n    Reception\n   \n\n\n\n    The Next Karate Kid\n   \n   has been critically panned.

    "context": "\n\n\n\n\n\n    The Karate Kid franchise\n   \n   is an American martial arts drama multimedia franchise, created by screenwriter\n   \n    Robert Mark Kamen\n   \n   . The franchise originally focused on\n   \n    Daniel LaRusso\n   \n   (\n   \n    Ralph Macchio\n   \n   ), a bullied new kid who forms a bond with his handyman\n   \n    Mr Miyagi\n   \n   (\n   \n    Pat Morita\n   \n   ), who happens to be a decorated Okinawan war veteran and master of karate. The focus shifted in the spin-off sequel\n   \n\n     The Next Karate Kid\n    \n\n   , which centered around\n   \n    Julie Pierce\n   \n   (\n   \n    Hilary Swank\n   \n   ) as she is taught to control her anger by\n   \n    Mr Miyagi\n   \n   (\n   \n    Pat Morita\n   \n   ).\n  \n\n   The success of the first two films spawned an animated television series that ran for thirteen episodes before its cancellation. In 2010, a remake of the first film was released starring Jaden Smith as the titular character\n   \n    Dre Parker\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Jackie Chan\n   \n   as kung-fu master,\n   \n    Mr. Han\n   \n   . In 2018, YouTube Premium announced a spinoff series of the franchise titled\n   \n\n     Cobra Kai\n    \n\n   , which reunites the original rivals\n   \n    Daniel LaRusso\n   \n   (\n   \n    Ralph Macchio\n   \n   ) and\n   \n    Johnny Lawrence\n   \n   (\n   \n    William Zabka\n   \n   ). The series currently airs on Netflix. The franchise has also had a lasting influence on both karate culture and teen film narratives in America.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Films\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n\n          The Karate Kid\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n\n          The Karate Kid Part II\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n\n          The Karate Kid Part III\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n\n          The Next Karate Kid\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       2010 Remake\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Television Series\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n\n          The Karate Kid\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n\n          Cobra Kai\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Films\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Karate Kid\n    \n\n\n\n   The franchise began in 1984 with\n   \n\n     The Karate Kid\n    \n\n   , starring\n   \n    Ralph Macchio\n   \n   and\n   \n    Pat Morita\n   \n   . The film was a success in box office and garnered a total of $100,000,000 despite only premiering in the United States and Canada. It was given an $8 million budget.\n  \n\n\n\n     The Karate Kid Part II\n    \n\n\n\n   Building off the success of the first film,\n   \n    The Karate Kid Part II\n   \n   was released in 1986 and once again starred Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. It introduced new characters\n   \n    Yukie\n   \n   (\n   \n    Nobu McCarthy\n   \n   ),\n   \n    Kumiko\n   \n   (\n   \n    Tamlyn Tomita\n   \n   ), and\n   \n    Chozen Toguchi\n   \n   (\n   \n    Yuji Okumoto\n   \n   ), among others. The film does not take place in Southern California, but rather, Okinawa, which differs from the first film. Despite negative reviews by critics,\n   \n    The Karate Kid Part II\n   \n   garnered $115,103,979 in box office. It was given a $13 million budget.\n  \n\n\n\n     The Karate Kid Part III\n    \n\n\n\n   The final film installment to include Ralph Macchio,\n   \n    The Karate Kid Part III\n   \n   was released in 1989, three years after the second film. It once more stars\n   \n    Ralph Macchio\n   \n   and\n   \n    Pat Morita\n   \n   in their now-iconic roles of\n   \n    Daniel LaRusso\n   \n   and\n   \n    Mr Miyagi\n   \n   respectively.\n   \n    The Karate Kid Part III\n   \n   also reunites the original films cast, bringing back fan favorites\n   \n    John Kreese\n   \n   (\n   \n    Martin Kove\n   \n   ),\n   \n    Johnny Lawrence\n   \n   (\n   \n    William Zabka\n   \n   ), and introduces the cunning\n   \n    Terry Silver\n   \n   (\n   \n    Thomas Ian Griffith\n   \n   ). The film was received negatively by critics and made the smallest amount in box office of the three films, garnering only $38,956,288 and a $12.5 million budget.\n  \n\n\n\n     The Next Karate Kid\n    \n\n\n\n   Capitalizing off the success of the original three films,\n   \n    The Next Karate Kid\n   \n   was released in 1994 and saw the final appearance of\n   \n    Pat Morita\n   \n   as\n   \n    Mr Miyagi\n   \n   . The film focused on Mr. Miyagi training a new female student,\n   \n    Julie Pierce\n   \n   (\n   \n    Hilary Swank\n   \n   ). Upon its release,\n   \n    The Next Karate Kid\n   \n   became a commercial and critical failure, with many viewing the film as having good acting, but saw it as unneeded. The film saw little success in box office with $15,826,984 and a $12 million budget.\n  \n\n\n    2010 Remake\n   \n\n\n   In 2010, a remake of the first film was released, and starred Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan as\n   \n    Dre Parker\n   \n   and\n   \n    Mr. Han\n   \n   respectively. The film was the largest release financially for the franchise, garnering $359,126,022 with a $40 million budget. It also earned nine film nominations and four wins. A sequel was ordered to the film, though nothing seemed to come from the order as Sony Pictures ordered a television series spin-off of the original three films in 2017.\n  \n\n\n    Television Series\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Karate Kid\n    \n\n\n\n   The success of the first two films spawned an animated television series that aired for thirteen episodes in 1989. While characters\n   \n    Daniel LaRusso\n   \n   and\n   \n    Mr Miyagi\n   \n   were centralized in the plot, they were not voiced by their film counterparts. Instead, the characters were voiced by Joey Dedio and Robert Ito respectively.\n   \n    Pat Morita\n   \n   reprised his role as Mr. Miyagi through a narration in which he explains the episode's plot from his character's point of view. The series was canceled after one season, and is not considered canon.\n  \n\n\n\n     Cobra Kai\n    \n\n\n\n   In 2017, it was announced that Sony Pictures had sold the rights of\n   \n    The Karate Kid\n   \n   franchise to YouTube Red for an action drama series that serves as a spin-off of the original three films. It stars\n   \n    Ralph Macchio\n   \n   and\n   \n    William Zabka\n   \n   , who reprise their 1980s roles of\n   \n    Daniel LaRusso\n   \n   and\n   \n    Johnny Lawrence\n   \n   . The series is set thirty-four years after the events of\n   \n    The Karate Kid\n   \n   , with the narrative being re-examined from Johnny's point of view. The series stars\n   \n    Mary Mouser\n   \n   as Daniel's daughter\n   \n    Samantha LaRusso\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Xolo Maridueña\n   \n   as Johnny's apprentice\n   \n    Miguel Diaz\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tanner Buchanan\n   \n   as Johnny's estranged son\n   \n    Robby Keene\n   \n   . The series also stars\n   \n    Jacob Bertrand\n   \n   as\n   \n    Hawk\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Gianni Decenzo\n   \n   as\n   \n    Demetri\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Martin Kove\n   \n   as\n   \n    John Kreese\n   \n   . The series reunites several former\n   \n    Karate Kid\n   \n   alums, including the long-awaited return of\n   \n    Elisabeth Shue\n   \n   as\n   \n    Ali Mills\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The series launched on YouTube Red with the first two seasons being released in 2018 to 2019. In June 2020, Netflix acquired the series, and the third season released on January 1, 2021. As of January 2021, the show has been watched by 73 million Netflix member households between the three seasons.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Ron Thomas\n    \n\n\n      Biographical Information\n     \n\n\n       Birth name\n      \n\n       Ronald Lee Thomas\n      \n\n\n\n       Birth place\n      \n\n       Reno, Nevada, United States\n      \n\n\n\n       Date of birth\n      \n\n       November 15, 1961\n      \n\n\n\n       Occupation\n      \n\n       Actor\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Appearance Information\n     \n\n\n       Appears in\n      \n\n\n\n         The Karate Kid\n        \n\n\n\n         The Karate Kid Part II\n        \n\n\n\n         Cobra Kai\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n       Character\n      \n\n\n        Bobby Brown\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Ronald Lee Thomas\n   \n   (Born November 15, 1961) is an American actor.

Johnson was born in 1939 in Niagara Falls, New York. He began training in traditional Korean Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan in 1963, while stationed in South Korea as a chaplain in the U.S. Army. While under the tutelage of a Korean master named Kang Lo Hee, Johnson earned his black belt in just thirteen months. After his army service ended, Johnson met and formed an association with Tang Soo Do instructor Chuck Norris. Johnson soon rose to the rank of chief instructor at Norris' school in Sherman Oaks, California in 1968. That same year, he formulated the\n   \n    penalty-point system\n   \n   still used by karate tournaments.\n  \n\n   From 1968 to 1973, Johnson was captain of the undefeated Chuck Norris black belt competition team, which won 33 consecutive national and international titles. In 1971, he became the National Tang Soo Do Champion. In both 1975 and 1976, Johnson was awarded the prestigious\n   \n    Golden Fist Award\n   \n   for best karate referee in the United States.\n  \n\n   In 1973, Norris founded the National Tang Soo Do Congress (NTC), and named Johnson as executive vice president and chief of instruction. In 1979, Norris disbanded the NTC and formed the United Fighting Arts Federation (UFAF), again naming Johnson as executive vice president.\n  \n\n   In 1980, Johnson had a small supporting role in the feature film\n   \n    The Little Dragons\n   \n   (later known as\n   \n    The Karate Kids U.S.A.\n   \n   ). In the film, Johnson played the karate instructor to a pair of young brothers (portrayed by Chris and Pat Petersen) who use their martial arts skills to foil a kidnapping plot.\n  \n\n   In 1984, Johnson served as Stunt Coordinator on\n   \n    The Karate Kid\n   \n   . Johnson also featured in the movie as the chief referee in the All Valley Karate Tournament. He was one of only four cast members who knew any Martial Arts before shooting began. The others being\n   \n    Chad McQueen\n   \n   (\n   \n    Dutch)\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ron Thomas\n   \n   (\n   \n    Bobby\n   \n   ), and\n   \n    Darryl Vidal\n   \n   , who was featured in the Semi Final against\n   \n    Johnny Lawrence\n   \n   . Vidal invented the infamous Crane Kick that sees\n   \n    Daniel\n   \n   win the\n   \n    tournament\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In 1986, Johnson was promoted to ninth-degree black belt. That same year after a difference of opinion with Norris, he would leave the UFAF and reform the NTC\n  \n\n\n    Filmography\n   \n\n\n   Johnson was known for outside of\n   \n    The Karate Kid\n   \n   trilogy such as\n   \n    Enter the Dragon, The Little Dragon, The Big Brawl, Golden Needles, Force: 5, The Ultimate Warrior, I Am Steve McQueen, and Cruise Missile.\n   \n\n\n\n    Character\n   \n\n\n\n    The Karate Kid\n   \n\n\n   Pat is present at the 1984 All Valley Under-18 Karate Tournament during sign ins.  He later breaks up a near fight between Dutch and Daniel LaRusso in the locker room. Pat later officiates many of the matches throughout the tournament. He is firm and fair in his officiating, threatening to remove a point from Daniel in his initial bout for running out of the ring, and disqualifies Bobby Brown in the semi-finals when he lands an illegal kick on Daniel.\n  \n\n\n    The Karate Kid Part II\n   \n\n\n   Pat appears in the aftermath of the 1984 All-Valley Under 18 Karate Tournament, along with the ring announcer, Bruce Malmuth. Both of them offer praise to Daniel for the Crane Kick that he lands on Johnny to win the tournament.\n  \n\n\n    The Karate Kid Part III\n   \n\n\n   Pat leaves a message on Cobra Kai's answering, informing Kreese that because Cobra Kai has failed to pay the dues that each dojo owes to the All Valley Karate Tournament, that Cobra Kai was being dropped from the rolls of eligible dojos. Pat officiates Mike Barnes' match in the semi-finals that puts him into the finals against Daniel LaRusso. He also officiates the final match between Daniel LaRusso against Barnes. He constantly is warning Mike Barnes for his actions and continues to deduct points from Barnes for his flagrant rule violations.  As a member of the All Valley Karate Tournament committee, he would have had a hand in implementing the lifetime ban on Cobra Kai Dojo for the actions at the 1985 Tournament by Terry Silver, John Kreese, and Mike Barnes.\n  \n\n\n    Trivia\n   \n\n\n   In the Karate Kid Special Edition DVD, Pat Johnson narrates and is the focus of the featurette BEYOND THE FORM, where he gives the entire history of the choreography that went into the Karate Kid.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "question": "Is Popeye a cartoon or a character?",
    "response": "Popeye is primarily a fictional character, not a cartoon itself. He was created by E.C. Segar in 1929 as a supporting character in the comic strip \"Thimble Theatre,\" and over time, he has been adapted into various formats like animated cartoons, films, and video games. This shows how a single character can appear in different media—comics being his origin, while cartoons are just one way he's been brought to life. For example, the Fleischer Studios turned him into popular theatrical shorts in the 1930s, but that doesn't change his fundamental identity as a character. Understanding this distinction helps us think critically about how stories and characters evolve through adaptations, like how Popeye's adventures highlight themes of strength, perseverance, and humor across comics and cartoons.",

Segar\n   \n   and was his third published strip. The strip first appeared in the\n   \n    New York Journal\n   \n   , a newspaper operated by King Features owner William Randolph Hearst, on December 19, 1919 before later expanding into more papers. In its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style (hence the strip's name).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre's\n   \n   first main characters / actors were the thin\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   and her boyfriend\n   \n    Harold Hamgravy\n   \n   . After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-adventure style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive's enterprising brother\n   \n    Castor Oyl\n   \n   . Olive's parents\n   \n    Cole\n   \n   and\n   \n    Nana Oyl\n   \n   also made frequent appearances.\n  \n\n   Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a\n   \n    ship\n   \n   for a voyage to\n   \n    Dice Island\n   \n   , the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of\n   \n    Bernice the Whiffle Hen\n   \n   . Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip, but due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.\n  \n\n   The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was expanded into many more newspapers as a result. Though initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Ham left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.\n  \n\n   In 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named \"\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   .\" Other regular characters in the strip were\n   \n    J. Wellington Wimpy\n   \n   , a\n   \n    hamburger\n   \n   -loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character);\n   \n    George W. Geezil\n   \n   , a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and\n   \n    Eugene the Jeep\n   \n   , a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with magical powers. In addition, the strip featured the\n   \n    Sea Hag\n   \n   , a terrible\n   \n    pirate\n   \n   , as well as the last witch on Earth (her even more terrible sister excepted);\n   \n    Alice the Goon\n   \n   , a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's babysitter; and\n   \n    Toar\n   \n   , a caveman.\n  \n\n   Segar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (\n   \n    Bill Barnacle\n   \n   , for example). Spinach usage was rare and\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a\n   \n    cigar\n   \n   due to his last name being a homophone of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   soon became one of King Features' most popular strips during the 1930s and, following an eventual name change to\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   in the 1970s, remains one of the longest running strips in syndication toda \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This article is about the franchise as a whole.

The strip, now titled\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   , continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition, written and drawn by\n   \n    Hy Eisman\n   \n   .

Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away.\n  \n\n   The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series,\n   \n\n     Dinky Dog\n    \n\n   , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to\n   \n\n     The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show\n    \n\n   and lasting until 1983. This series was also the last time\n   \n    Jack Mercer\n   \n   voiced Popeye before his death.\n  \n\n\n    Segments\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye/The Adventures of Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      The Popeye Sports Parade\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye's Treasure Hunt\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Prehistoric Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Private Olive Oyl\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Dinky Dog\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Also, in between the above segments, untitled, short \"\n   \n    morals\n   \n   \" would be featured, often starring\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye and Pupeye\n   \n   engaging in potentially harmful activities, sometimes encouraged by\n   \n    Mr. No-No\n   \n   . This would prompt Popeye to teach his nephews, along with the children in the audience, a life lesson.\n  \n\n\n    Film\n   \n\n\n   In the second year of the series, there was also a holiday television film:\n   .\n  \n\n\n    at the Internet Movie Database\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "question": "My name is Popeye.. I am full of rock hard muscle.",
    "response": "Hello, Popeye! It's great to hear from you—sounds like you're ready for some spinach-fueled adventures! Since you're all about that rock-hard muscle, I can connect that to the Popeye Career Awareness Library, a fun series of educational comic books from 1972 that uses your character to explain real-world careers. These comics make learning engaging by showing how you, the sailor, explore different jobs.\n\nLet me highlight a few careers from the series that might interest you, based on your introduction and the topics mentioned:\n\n- **Health Careers**: In the \"Popeye the Sailor and Health Careers\" issue, you dive into roles like doctors, nurses, and physical therapists. It shows how these professionals keep people strong and healthy, much like how you stay fit with your spinach. For example, it explains the importance of exercise and nutrition in health fields, which ties right into your muscular lifestyle.\n\n- **Environmental Careers**: The \"Popeye and Environmental Careers\" comic explores jobs like conservationists, park rangers, and scientists who protect the oceans and forests. As a sailor, you'd appreciate how these careers involve cleaning up pollution and preserving nature, ensuring the seas are safe for adventures—just like in your stories!\n\n- **Transportation Careers**: In \"Popeye and Transportation Careers,\" you learn about pilots, truck drivers, and ship captains. It covers how these roles keep goods and people moving efficiently, which could relate to your seafaring exploits. For instance, it discusses navigation skills and safety protocols that help in exploring new horizons.\n\nIf you'd like more details on any of these—like specific job descriptions, skills needed, or how to get started—just let me know. What's your next adventure in career exploration?",

    "question": "Why does Popeye always eat spinach?",
    "response": "Popeye eats spinach in his stories primarily as a narrative device for empowerment, which ties into both the fictional adventures and real-world cultural messages. In the comics and animations, spinach gives Popeye an instant surge of super strength, allowing him to defeat villains like Bluto and protect characters like Olive Oyl. This started in early animations by Fleischer Studios, where it became a staple plot element, turning tense situations into humorous resolutions and enabling Popeye to perform extraordinary feats, like breaking physical laws or transforming objects.\n\nCulturally, this portrayal promotes the health benefits of spinach, a leafy vegetable rich in vitamins, by associating it with strength and heroism. Popeye's love for spinach has influenced public health awareness, encouraging people—especially children—to eat greens, as seen in real-world honors like statues and branded products. In applying this to everyday life, you can recognize how entertainment shapes habits; for instance, Popeye's stories demonstrate how media can make healthy eating fun and inspiring, potentially leading to better dietary choices and increased awareness of nutrition.",
    "context": "\n\n\n\n\n\n    Spinach\n   \n   is a leafy vegetable with a high vitamin content, making it a healthy and nutritious food for human consumption. In most media featuring\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   , it is used as a last-minute device in which the hero, in danger, pulls out a can of spinach from his shirt or otherwise acquires the vegetable and eats it. This gives his already extraordinary strength a tremendous boost, helping him withstand his enemies' attacks and all kinds of adverse situations.\n  \n\n   This did not initially exist in\n   \n    Segar\n   \n   's comic\n   \n\n     Thimble Theatre\n    \n\n   , where Popeye originated, later simply becoming the food that Popeye favored in order to remain strong, before seeing more widespread use in post-Segar comics. Since the earliest animated cartoons, however, as produced by\n   \n    Fleischer Studios\n   \n   , it was introduced in its strength-boosting capacity and in this form would remain a staple of all of Popeye's screen incarnations.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       The hero's empowerment\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       The villain's comeuppance\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Spinach as eaten by others\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Extraordinary uses\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Public views\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Notes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    The hero's empowerment\n   \n\n\n   The animated cartoons more notedly adhere to a format in which spinach is Popeye's main means for overcoming the greatest of obstacles. Even if the cartoon acknowledges Popeye's immense strength to begin with (later ones from the\n   \n    Famous\n   \n   era make him much weaker before spinach), consumption of the vegetable augments Popeye's physical might to the extreme, allowing the viewer to enjoy a power fantasy and enabling the\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   to even break the laws of physics at times.\n  \n\n\n    The villain's comeuppance\n   \n\n\n   In Popeye's dealings with opponents such as\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   , spinach is consumed when the sailor's well-being is threatened or\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   is on the verge of being abused. After eating the vegetable, Popeye strikes at the antagonist with his increased strength, wherein the blows can immediately render the erstwhile competitor unconscious, send him airborne to a distant destination, initiate the use of various props which serve to immobilize and otherwise humble him, etc. Often, this comeuppance comes in the form of a humorous reprieve to what had been a tense and life-threatening situation and serves as a concluding \"punchline\" for the cartoon episode.\n  \n\n\n    Spinach as eaten by others\n   \n\n\n   Popeye is not the only character in the\n   \n    franchise\n   \n   to eat spinach; other characters have consumed it as well. For cases involving female antagonists such as\n   \n    the Sea Hag\n   \n   , since Popeye cannot clobber women, it is Olive Oyl who ingests the vegetable in order to defeat the villainess. In the theatrical shorts\n   \n\n     Hospitaliky\n    \n\n   , its color remake\n   \n\n     For Better or Nurse\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Beaus Will Be Beaus\n    \n\n   , Popeye force-feeds Bluto spinach. At least in the animated cartoons, everybody would gain a surge of power comparable to Popeye's. Interestingly enough, while being so powerful, it is commercially available in Popeye's stories. Literally anyone can buy a can of spinach at the nearby grocery, but Popeye seems the only consumer. Brutus once managed to monopolize the spinach market to depower Popeye, but the villain himself did not consume it.\n  \n\n\n    Popeye Junior\n   \n   sometimes eats spinach to increase his strength but he dislikes the vegetable.\n  \n\n\n    Extraordinary uses\n   \n\n\n\n    Spinach increases the strength and speed of a character.\n   \n\n    It makes Popeye invulnerable, giving him a skin as resilient as steel.\n   \n\n    It can turn Popeye into a rocket, transform his clothes or otherwise change his appearance.\n   \n\n    It has been used to transform a biplane into a F-18 Hornet and perform other such changes.\n   \n\n    Once, Popeye summoned a knight's armor and horse with spinach. (\n    \n\n      Ancient Fistory\n     \n\n    )\n   \n\n    Rubbing the can of spinach, Popeye could do deeds to rival Aladdin's lamp (\n    \n\n      Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp\n     \n     )\n    \n    .\n   \n\n    Spinach was used to negate the effects of a fast-aging ray when Popeye was abducted by\n    \n     aliens\n    \n    (\n    \n\n      Popeye, the Ace of Space\n     \n\n    ).\n   \n\n    Ye King's Spinach, a variety that Popeye found in a haunted\n    \n     ship\n    \n    , could turn him invisible (\n    \n\n      Spooky Swabs\n     \n\n    ).\n   \n\n    Popeye gathered the necessary materials and built a full, armored house in a few seconds after eating spinach (\n    \n\n      Insect to Injury\n     \n\n    ).\n   \n\n    Spinach can increase the strength of a common gopher to knock down a\n    \n     bull\n    \n    (\n    \n\n      Gopher Spinach\n     \n\n    ).\n   \n\n    It could turn an innoffensive pig into a furious boar (\"Bad Company\").\n   \n\n    Empowered by spinach, Popeye was able to tow a whole fleet of ships (\"\n    \n     Popeye Snags the Sea Hag\n    \n    \").\n   \n\n    The vegetable could fix a broken sword and give mastery over fencing (\n    \n\n      Parlez Vous Woo\n     \n\n    ).\n   \n\n\n     Poopdeck Pappy\n    \n    , after eating spinach, was able to have a massive fight against the\n    \n     Goons\n    \n    , so powerful that he even tore the cartoon's film reel (\n    \n\n      Goonland\n     \n\n    ).\n   \n\n    Spinach can boost the intelligence, artistical abilities, etcetera.\n   \n\n    A sped-up, intrumental version of Popeye's theme song plays when he eats Spinach. A number of songs can play after he eats spinach, including Stars and Stripes Forever, a version of Yankee Doodle, and a few other (unknown) songs.\n   \n\n\n\n    Public views\n   \n\n\n   Spinach is widely associated to Popeye by the public. Due to his promoting the vegetable, the\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   hero has received honors from the spinach industry, such as the statue erected in Crystal City, Texas (the \"Spinach Capitol [sic] of the World\", as described on its Popeye-featuring welcome sign) in 1937.\n  \n\n   Popeye-brand spinach (pictured right) continues to be sold by the Allen Canning Company.\n  \n\n\n    Notes\n   \n\n\n\n    As animated and comics stories where Popeye eats spinach usually end soon afterwards, it is difficult to know exactly when or how the empowering effect wears off.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          How Green Is My Spinach\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Number 169\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n        Guide\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n      previous\n      \n       The Fly's Last Flight\n      \n\n\n      next\n      \n       Gym Jam\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     How Green Is My Spinach\n    \n\n   is\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   's 169th cartoon, released in 1950 by\n   \n    Famous Studios\n   \n   . The cartoon in fact contains three title cards:\n   \n\n     How Green Is My Spinach\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n\n     Popeye in Spinach Sockeroo\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Popeye in Strictly from Spinach\n    \n\n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Plot\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Cast\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Plot\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      How Green is My Spinach:\n     \n\n\n   Begins with\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   jumping on Popeye's chest, who simply eats his\n   \n    spinach\n   \n   and proceeds to punch Bluto into a garbage can.\n  \n\n\n\n\n      Popeye in Spinach Sockeroo:\n     \n\n\n   The second \"story\" has Bluto repeatedly punching Popeye against a wall until the contents of his spinach can fall into his mouth, enabling him to strike back and leaving his enemy's head encased in a cuckoo clock.\n  \n\n\n\n\n      Popeye in Strictly From Spinach:\n     \n\n\n   Bluto shoots a tied-up yet unconcerned Popeye from a\n   \n    ship\n   \n   's cannon. Sucking his spinach with his\n   \n    pipe\n   \n   , he turns around, transforms into a missile and hits Bluto, sending him flying to be left hanging from the edge of the moon.\n  \n\n   At the end of this last vignette, Bluto begins to cry and lament Popeye's empowering usage of spinach, until he realizes that if the vegetable were to disappear, he could finally destroy his enemy. Next, he mixes various evil substances into a huge vat, the resulting chemical successfully killing a small spinach plant. He boards a small fighter plane and makes a devastating run over the spinach fields. As Popeye is helping repair a spinach-carrying wagon, Bluto flies by leaving his toxic mist to suck the truck's contents away. Through a nearby store window, Popeye and some children see a news report tell of the mysterious vanishing of spinach everywhere, and the children cheer.\n  \n\n   Not even his trusty can is safe, as Bluto is nearby and sprays it with his noxious toxin. Unable to defeat his nemesis, Popeye runs into a supermarket that carries spinach, but it is likewise eliminated. The\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   has no choice but to try out other vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, cabbage, celery and potatoes - none giving him the strength to even hurt Bluto. The latter begins to sweep the floor with Popeye, rain down punches upon him and otherwise pummel him.\n  \n\n   A narrator relays all of this to the concerned live-action audience of the theatrical cartoon, finally asking \"Is there a can of spinach in the house?\" A saddened boy checks the grocery bag he had brought to the movies and finds a can of the greens, then throws it into the screen to reach Popeye. Again empowered, the hero multiplies five-fold and punches his enemy, then uses him as a beast of burden to help seed the spinach fields again. The wonder veggie begins to grow immediately, cans and all.\n  \n\n\n    Cast\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Jackson Beck\n    \n    -\n    \n     Bluto\n    \n    , TV Announcer, Narrator\n   \n\n\n     Jack Mercer\n    \n    -\n    \n     Popeye\n    \n\n\n    Cecil Roy - Boy\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Popeye's Island Adventures\n    \n\n   , also called\n   \n\n     Popeye for Kids\n    \n\n   , is a 2018 animated\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   web series produced by WildBrain subsidiary WildBrain Spark Studios, which premiered on the\n   \n    Popeye & Friends Official\n   \n   YouTube channel and can currently be seen on its own\n   \n    Popeye for Kids\n   \n   channel.

    "question": "explain the history of popeye?",
    "response": "Popeye, the iconic spinach-loving sailor, has a rich history in comics that spans nearly a century, evolving from a newspaper strip character to educational and mainstream comic books. Below is a structured, chronological overview based on available records, focusing on its origins, key publications, artists, publishers, and cultural impact.\n\n### Origins in Comic Strips (Early 1900s to 1930s)\nPopeye first appeared in 1929 as a supporting character in the comic strip *Thimble Theatre*, created by E.C. Segar. The strip, originally focused on other characters, quickly shifted to Popeye due to his popularity. Segar's work emphasized Popeye's tough, humorous personality and introduced elements like his superhuman strength from eating spinach. Early publications included hardcover collections of the daily strips in the 1930s, such as those by Sonnet (1931–1932), which helped solidify Popeye's place in popular culture.\n\n### Transition to Comic Books and Early Series (1940s to 1950s)\nIn the 1940s, Popeye moved into comic books with publishers like Dell and David McKay. The first major comic book series began in 1948 under Dell Publishing, initially titled *Popeye* and later *Popeye the Sailor*. This series, which ran until 1984 across various publishers, featured self-contained stories rather than serialized ones, allowing for standalone adventures. Bud Sagendorf, Segar's former assistant, took over as the primary artist and writer, introducing new elements like backup series (e.g., *Axle and Cam* and *Sherm!*) and short text stories. This era marked Popeye's expansion into broader media, including the famous animated shorts, and highlighted his cultural impact as a symbol of strength and perseverance.\n\n### Expansion and Educational Focus (1960s to 1970s)\nThe 1960s saw the series continue under Western Publishing's Gold Key brand starting with issue #66 in 1962, maintaining the *Popeye the Sailor* title. Sagendorf continued his work until retiring, after which artists like George Wildman took over. In 1969, Charlton Comics picked up the series with issue #94. A significant milestone was the 1972 *Popeye Career Awareness Library*, a series of 15 educational comic books published by King Features. This set, sold in a box by Milton Bradley, featured Popeye explaining various careers (e.g., health, environmental, and transportation careers) in a more articulate manner than in his typical appearances. Drawn by George Wildman, this series underscored Popeye's educational impact, aiming to inform young readers about real-world professions while blending entertainment with learning.\n\n### Later Publications and Revivals (1980s to Present)\nBy the 1980s, the main series concluded with its 177th issue in 1984 under Whitman (a Western Publishing brand). Subsequent years saw reprints and new collections, such as those by Fantagraphics in the 1980s and 1990s, which compiled Segar's original strips. In the 2000s and 2010s, IDW Publishing revived interest with series like *Popeye Classics* (starting in 2012) and crossovers like *Mars Attacks Popeye* (2013). These modern reprints, under the Yoe Comics brand, have kept Popeye relevant, emphasizing his historical significance in comics.\n\nOverall, Popeye's evolution reflects a shift from serialized newspaper strips to standalone comic books and educational materials, involving key artists like E.C. Segar (founder), Bud Sagendorf (long-term steward), and George Wildman (educational era). Publishers such as Dell, Western, Charlton, and IDW played crucial roles in this transition. Culturally, Popeye has promoted values like health, strength, and career awareness, making him a enduring figure in American entertainment with lasting educational influence.",

This format continued in early issues of the\n   \n    Four Color\n   \n   comic book series by\n   \n    Dell Publishing\n   \n   , before evolving into new stories and art by\n   \n    Bud Sagendorf\n   \n   , formerly the assistant of Popeye creator\n   E. C. Segar\n   . These issues were followed by\n   \n    the first and most famous Popeye comic series\n   \n   in 1948, published by Dell, also with the talent of Bud Sagendorf. Many other editions by several publishers have been released over the years as well.\n  \n\n   The Dell series was first simply called\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   . It was later titled\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   , as it continued with\n   Western Publishing\n   under the brand Gold Key with issue #66 in 1962. This title was kept by the publishers that followed.\n  \n\n   This comic book series mostly dealt with self-contained tales (unlike the original, serialized comic strip), usually featuring a longer lead story starring Popeye and a few shorter backups headlined by either Popeye or other characters. Sagendorf even introduced new backup series such as\n   \n    Axle and Cam\n   \n   or\n   \n    Sherm!\n   \n   and equally used Segar's complement to the daily strip,\n   \n    Sappo\n   \n   , as the supporting feature in the book.

This format continued in early issues of the\n   \n    Four Color\n   \n   comic book series by\n   \n    Dell Publishing\n   \n   , before evolving into new stories and art by\n   \n    Bud Sagendorf\n   \n   , formerly the assistant of Popeye creator\n   \n    E. C. Segar\n   \n   . These issues were followed by\n   \n    the first and most famous Popeye comic series\n   \n   in 1948, published by Dell, also with the talent of Bud Sagendorf. Many other editions by several publishers have been released over the years as well.\n  \n\n   The Dell series was first simply called\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   . It was later titled\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   , as it continued with\n   Western Publishing\n   under the brand Gold Key with issue #66 in 1962. This title was kept by the publishers that followed.\n  \n\n   This comic book series mostly dealt with self-contained tales (unlike the original, serialized comic strip), usually featuring a longer lead story starring Popeye and a few shorter backups headlined by either Popeye or other characters. Sagendorf even introduced new backup series such as\n   \n\n     Axle and Cam\n    \n\n   or\n   \n    Sherm!\n   \n   and equally used Segar's complement to the daily strip,\n   \n\n     Sappo\n    \n\n   , as the supporting feature in the book. Short\n   \n    text stories\n   \n   would also be included, as well as the later\n   \n    Popeye's Physical Fitness Program\n   \n   , with the format changing through the years.\n  \n\n   Sagendorf eventually retired from the series, leaving his duties to artists such as\n   \n    George Wildman\n   \n   , while the series was picked up by Charlton Comics with issue #94 in 1969. Wildman stayed on when the series was once again picked up by Western Publishing, under the brands Gold Key and Whitman, until the final 171st issue in 1984.\n  \n\n   This series is currently being reprinted by\n   \n    IDW Publishing\n   \n   under the brand Yoe Comics, which began in 2012. IDW also ran another series titled\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   from 2012 to 2013, as well as a\n   \n\n     Mars Attacks Popeye\n    \n\n   special in 2013.\n  \n\n\n    Publications\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Title\n     \n\n      Publisher(s)\n     \n\n      Issue Numbers\n     \n\n      Publication Dates\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Sonnet\n     \n\n      #1 - #2\n     \n\n      1931 - 1932\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Paint Book\n      \n\n\n      McLaughlin Bros.\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1932\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Cartoon Book\n      \n\n\n      Saalfield\n     \n\n      #2095\n     \n\n      1934\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      David McKay\n     \n\n      #1 - #2\n     \n\n      1935\n     \n\n\n\n\n       King Comics\n      \n\n\n      David McKay\n     \n\n      #1 - #155\n     \n\n      1936 - 1949\n     \n\n\n\n\n       King Comics\n      \n\n\n      Best Books\n     \n\n      #156 - #159\n     \n\n      1950 - 1952\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      /\n      \n       Popeye and Wimpy\n      \n\n\n      Four Color\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1942 - 1949\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n        Popeye\n       \n       /\n       \n        Popeye the Sailor\n       \n\n\n\n      Dell, Western, King Features, Charlton\n     \n\n      #1 - #177\n     \n\n      1948 - 1984\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Saalfield\n     \n\n      #9212\n     \n\n      1969\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      [Bold Detergent Giveaway]\n     \n\n      Charlton\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1969\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theater Starring Popeye the Sailor\n      \n\n\n      Nostalgia Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1971\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      #E1 - #E15\n     \n\n      1972 - 1972\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      [Giant Comic Album]\n     \n\n      Modern\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1972\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      #L2\n     \n\n      1974\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      \"\n      \n       Getting Better Grades\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1974\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      Add\n     \n\n      1975\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Kite Fun Book\n      \n\n\n      Western\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre, Introducing Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Hyperion Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre, Introducing Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Hyperion Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye The First Fifty Years\n      \n\n\n      Workman\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      May 1979\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye the Sailor\n      \n\n\n      Nostalgia Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1979\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Tempo Books\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1979 - 1980\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye and the Jeep\n      \n\n\n      Tony Raiola\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1982\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Prophetic Allegory: Popeye and the American Dream: Two Classics by E.

    "question": "how many chracters in this cartoon?",
    "response": "Based on the description in the context, \"You're a Sap, Mr. Jap\" primarily features Popeye as the main character, who singlehandedly battles a group of Japanese antagonists. Here's a breakdown of the characters:\n\n- **Popeye**: The protagonist and only named character from the Popeye series in this cartoon.\n- **Japanese Naval Commander**: A key antagonist who plays a significant role in the plot.\n- **Japanese Crew Members**: These are not individually named but are depicted as a group on the battleship, implying multiple unnamed characters (likely several sailors).\n\nWhile an exact count isn't specified in the available information, the cartoon seems to involve at least 2-3 distinct characters (Popeye and the commander, plus the crew as a collective group). This makes it a simpler, more focused story compared to other Popeye cartoons. Keep in mind that this is a World War II propaganda piece, which uses stereotypes, so it's important to view it in its historical context rather than as entertainment.",

The cartoon was kept out of commercial release for years due to its racially offensive caricaturing of the Japanese and to the climactic sequence where the Japanese naval commander commits suicide by drinking gasoline and consuming lit firecrackers.\n  \n\n   However, it re-emerged in a November 2008 DVD release of Popeye cartoons produced between 1941 to 1943.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n    Famous Studios\n   \n   was the animation division of\n   Paramount Pictures\n   , founded in 1942 after Paramount took control of\n   \n    Fleischer Studios\n   \n   and ousted its founders\n   Max\n   and\n   Dave Fleischer\n   in 1941.

All remaining cartoons, beginning with\n   \n    Her Honor the Mare\n   \n   , are in color.

The original opening and closing Paramount titles were cut for TV syndication. By the early 2000s, the Popeye shorts were owned by Turner Entertainment, whose Cartoon Network broadcast restored versions of many of the shorts as part of an anthology series called\n   \n\n     The Popeye Show\n    \n\n   .

The first 14 shorts (\n   \n\n     You're a Sap, Mr. Jap\n    \n\n   through\n   \n    Cartoons Ain't Human\n   \n   ) are in black-and-white. All remaining cartoons, beginning with\n   \n\n     Her Honor the Mare\n    \n\n   , are in color. Unlike the Fleischer Studios entries, the director credits for these shorts represent the actual director in charge of that short's production. The first animator credited handled the animation direction. The numbers listed next to each cartoon continue the numbering of the Fleischer entries.\n  \n\n   The black-and white Popeye cartoons were sold to television distributors Associated Artists Productions (a.a.p.) in 1956, and the color cartoons were sold to a.a.p. the following year. The original opening and closing Paramount titles were cut for TV syndication. By the early 2000s, the Popeye shorts were owned by Turner Entertainment, whose Cartoon Network broadcast restored versions of many of the shorts as part of an anthology series called\n   \n\n     The Popeye Show\n    \n\n   .

the American television channel CBS from 1978 to 1983.\n  \n\n   The show stars\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   , in an attempt by Hanna-Barbera to bring him back to his comic roots. Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   clothes, abandoning the white\n   \n    Navy\n   \n   uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show,\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   (though he still wore a Navy sailor's cap, as in certain comics).\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed\n   \n    Brutus\n   \n   as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away.\n  \n\n   The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series,\n   \n\n     Dinky Dog\n    \n\n   , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to\n   \n\n     The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show\n    \n\n   and lasting until 1983. This series was also the last time\n   \n    Jack Mercer\n   \n   voiced Popeye before his death.\n  \n\n\n    Segments\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye/The Adventures of Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      The Popeye Sports Parade\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye's Treasure Hunt\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Prehistoric Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Private Olive Oyl\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Dinky Dog\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Also, in between the above segments, untitled, short \"\n   \n    morals\n   \n   \" would be featured, often starring\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye and Pupeye\n   \n   engaging in potentially harmful activities, sometimes encouraged by\n   \n    Mr. No-No\n   \n   . This would prompt Popeye to teach his nephews, along with the children in the audience, a life lesson.\n  \n\n\n    Film\n   \n\n\n   In the second year of the series, there was also a holiday television film:\n   .\n  \n\n\n    at the Internet Movie Database\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This article is about the franchise as a whole.

For other meanings, see\n      Popeye (disambiguation)\n      .\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n    Popeye the Sailor\n   \n   was created by\n   \n    E. C. Segar\n   \n   as a supporting character in the daily\n   \n    King Features\n   \n   comic strip\n   \n\n     Thimble Theatre\n    \n\n   , appearing on January 17, 1929. The character has since continued to appear in comics and animated cartoons, in the cinema as well as on television.\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   also became the strip's title in later years.\n  \n\n   Even though Segar's\n   \n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   strip was in its 10th year when Popeye made his debut in 1929, the\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   quickly became the main focus of the strip and\n   \n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   became one of King Features's most popular properties during the 1930s.\n   \n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   was continued after Segar's death in 1938 by several writers and artists, most notably Segar's assistant\n   \n    Bud Sagendorf\n   \n   . The strip, now titled\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   , continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition, written and drawn by\n   \n    Hy Eisman\n   \n   . The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories.\n  \n\n   In 1933,\n   \n    Max\n   \n   and\n   \n    Dave Fleischer\n   \n   's\n   \n    Fleischer Studios\n   \n   adapted the\n   \n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   characters into a series of\n   \n    Popeye the Sailor\n   \n   theatrical cartoon shorts for\n   \n    Paramount Pictures\n   \n   . These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and the Fleischers — and later Paramount's own\n   \n    Famous Studios\n   \n   — continued production through 1957. These cartoon shorts are now owned by WarnerMedia, a division of AT&T, and distributed by sister company Warner Bros. Entertainment.\n  \n\n   Over the years, Popeye has also appeared in comic books, television cartoons, arcade and\n   \n    video games\n   \n   , hundreds of advertisements and peripheral products, and a\n   \n    1980 live-action film\n   \n   directed by\n   \n    Robert Altman\n   \n   starring comedian\n   \n    Robin Williams\n   \n   as Popeye.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Fictional character and story\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.1\n        \n\n         Artists after Segar\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Comic books\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Animated cartoons\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Theme song\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Other media\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.1\n        \n\n         Radio\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.2\n        \n\n         Films\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.3\n        \n\n         Video and pinball games\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.4\n        \n\n         Marketing, tie-ins, and endorsements\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       Cultural origins and impact\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         7.1\n        \n\n         Spinach\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         7.2\n        \n\n         Word coinages\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         7.3\n        \n\n         Events and honors\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Reprints\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n\n        Thimble Theatre\n       \n       /Popeye characters\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.1\n        \n\n         Characters originating in the comic strips\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.2\n        \n\n         Characters originating in the cartoons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       10\n      \n\n       Filmography\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         10.1\n        \n\n         Theatrical and Television cartoons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         10.2\n        \n\n         Television specials and feature-length films\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         10.3\n        \n\n         DVD collections\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       11\n      \n\n       Sources\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Fictional character and story\n   \n\n\n   Differences in\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   's story and characterization show up depending upon which medium he is presented in. While\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   is definitively the ward of Popeye in the comic strips, he is often depicted as belonging to\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   in cartoons. The cartoons also occasionally feature family members of Popeye that have never appeared in the strip, notably his look-alike nephews\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye, and Pupeye\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Even though there is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Though at times he seems bereft of manners or uneducated, Popeye is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that (to the police, or, most importantly, the scientific community) seem insurmountable. Popeye has, alternatively, displayed Sherlock Holmes-like investigative prowess (determining for instance that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains' footprints in the sand), scientific ingenuity (as his construction, within a few hours, of a \"\n   \n    spinach\n   \n   -drive\"\n   \n    spaceship\n   \n   ), or oversimplified (yet successful) diplomatic argumentation (by presenting to diplomatic conferences his own existence --- and superhuman strength --- as the only true guarantee of world peace).\n  \n\n   Popeye's vastly versatile exploits are deemed even more amusing by a few standard plot elements. One is the love triangle between Popeye, Olive, and\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   , and the latter's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his (near-saintly) perseverance to overcome any obstacle to please Olive – who, quite often, renounces Popeye for Bluto's dime-store advances. She is the only character Popeye will permit to give him a thumping. Finally, in terms of the endless array of villain plots, Popeye mostly comes to the truth by \"accidentally\" sneaking up on the villains, the moment they are bragging about their schemes' ingenuity, thus revealing everything to an enraged Popeye, who uses his \"fisks\" in the name of justice.\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips\n   \n\n\n\n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   was created by\n   \n    King Features Syndicate\n   \n   comic writer / artist\n   \n    E.C. Segar\n   \n   and was his third published strip. The strip first appeared in the\n   \n    New York Journal\n   \n   , a newspaper operated by King Features owner William Randolph Hearst, on December 19, 1919 before later expanding into more papers. In its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style (hence the strip's name).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre's\n   \n   first main characters / actors were the thin\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   and her boyfriend\n   \n    Harold Hamgravy\n   \n   . After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-adventure style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive's enterprising brother\n   \n    Castor Oyl\n   \n   . Olive's parents\n   \n    Cole\n   \n   and\n   \n    Nana Oyl\n   \n   also made frequent appearances.\n  \n\n   Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a\n   \n    ship\n   \n   for a voyage to\n   \n    Dice Island\n   \n   , the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of\n   \n    Bernice the Whiffle Hen\n   \n   . Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip, but due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.\n  \n\n   The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was expanded into many more newspapers as a result. Though initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Ham left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.\n  \n\n   In 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named \"\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   .\" Other regular characters in the strip were\n   \n    J. Wellington Wimpy\n   \n   , a\n   \n    hamburger\n   \n   -loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character);\n   \n    George W. Geezil\n   \n   , a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and\n   \n    Eugene the Jeep\n   \n   , a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with magical powers. In addition, the strip featured the\n   \n    Sea Hag\n   \n   , a terrible\n   \n    pirate\n   \n   , as well as the last witch on Earth (her even more terrible sister excepted);\n   \n    Alice the Goon\n   \n   , a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's babysitter; and\n   \n    Toar\n   \n   , a caveman.\n  \n\n   Segar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (\n   \n    Bill Barnacle\n   \n   , for example). Spinach usage was rare and\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a\n   \n    cigar\n   \n   due to his last name being a homophone of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   soon became one of King Features' most popular strips during the 1930s and, following an eventual name change to\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   in the 1970s, remains one of the longest running strips in syndication toda",

    "context": "\n\n\n\n\n   There have been several\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   publications since the character first appeared among the cast of\n   \n\n     Thimble Theatre\n    \n\n   , starting with hardcover bound collections of the daily strips throughout the 1930s. This format continued in early issues of the\n   \n    Four Color\n   \n   comic book series by\n   \n    Dell Publishing\n   \n   , before evolving into new stories and art by\n   \n    Bud Sagendorf\n   \n   , formerly the assistant of Popeye creator\n   E. C. Segar\n   . These issues were followed by\n   \n    the first and most famous Popeye comic series\n   \n   in 1948, published by Dell, also with the talent of Bud Sagendorf. Many other editions by several publishers have been released over the years as well.\n  \n\n   The Dell series was first simply called\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   . It was later titled\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   , as it continued with\n   Western Publishing\n   under the brand Gold Key with issue #66 in 1962. This title was kept by the publishers that followed.\n  \n\n   This comic book series mostly dealt with self-contained tales (unlike the original, serialized comic strip), usually featuring a longer lead story starring Popeye and a few shorter backups headlined by either Popeye or other characters. Sagendorf even introduced new backup series such as\n   \n    Axle and Cam\n   \n   or\n   \n    Sherm!\n   \n   and equally used Segar's complement to the daily strip,\n   \n    Sappo\n   \n   , as the supporting feature in the book. Short\n   \n    text stories\n   \n   would also be included, as well as the later\n   \n    Popeye's Physical Fitness Program\n   \n   , with the format changing through the years.\n  \n\n   Sagendorf eventually retired from the series, leaving his duties to artists such as\n   \n    George Wildman\n   \n   , while the series was picked up by Charlton Comics with issue #94 in 1969. Wildman stayed on when the series was once again picked up by Western Publishing, under the brands Gold Key and Whitman, until the final 171st issue in 1984.\n  \n\n   This series is currently being reprinted by\n   \n    IDW Publishing\n   \n   under the brand Yoe Comics, which began in 2012. IDW also ran another series titled\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   from 2012 to 2013, as well as a\n   \n\n     Mars Attacks Popeye\n    \n\n   special in 2013.\n  \n\n\n    Publications\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Title\n     \n\n      Publisher(s)\n     \n\n      Issue Numbers\n     \n\n      Publication Dates\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Sonnet\n     \n\n      #1 - #2\n     \n\n      1931 - 1932\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Paint Book\n      \n\n\n      McLaughlin Bros.\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1932\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Cartoon Book\n      \n\n\n      Saalfield\n     \n\n      #2095\n     \n\n      1934\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      David McKay\n     \n\n      #1 - #2\n     \n\n      1935\n     \n\n\n\n\n       King Comics\n      \n\n\n      David McKay\n     \n\n      #1 - #155\n     \n\n      1936 - 1949\n     \n\n\n\n\n       King Comics\n      \n\n\n      Best Books\n     \n\n      #156 - #159\n     \n\n      1950 - 1952\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      /\n      \n       Popeye and Wimpy\n      \n\n\n      Four Color\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1942 - 1949\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n        Popeye\n       \n       /\n       \n        Popeye the Sailor\n       \n\n\n\n      Dell, Western, King Features, Charlton\n     \n\n      #1 - #177\n     \n\n      1948 - 1984\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Saalfield\n     \n\n      #9212\n     \n\n      1969\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      [Bold Detergent Giveaway]\n     \n\n      Charlton\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1969\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theater Starring Popeye the Sailor\n      \n\n\n      Nostalgia Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1971\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      #E1 - #E15\n     \n\n      1972 - 1972\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      [Giant Comic Album]\n     \n\n      Modern\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1972\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      #L2\n     \n\n      1974\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      \"\n      \n       Getting Better Grades\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1974\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      Add\n     \n\n      1975\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Kite Fun Book\n      \n\n\n      Western\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre, Introducing Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Hyperion Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre, Introducing Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Hyperion Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye The First Fifty Years\n      \n\n\n      Workman\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      May 1979\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye the Sailor\n      \n\n\n      Nostalgia Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1979\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Tempo Books\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1979 - 1980\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye and the Jeep\n      \n\n\n      Tony Raiola\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1982\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Prophetic Allegory: Popeye and the American Dream: Two Classics by E.

    "question": "who is Popeye? ",
    "response": "Popeye is an iconic cartoon character originally created for the \"Thimble Theatre\" comic strip in the early 20th century. He is depicted as a tough, pipe-smoking sailor known for his superhuman strength, which he gains from eating spinach. Popeye has appeared in various media, including the 1972 \"Popeye Career Awareness Library\" educational comic series, where he explains different careers, and the 1960-1963 TV series \"Popeye the Sailor,\" produced by King Features Syndicate. He symbolizes perseverance, strength, and moral integrity, making him a cultural icon that promotes values like standing up for what's right.",

    "question": "How old is Popeye?",
    "response": "I'm glad you're curious about Popeye—it's a great way to dive into how fictional characters are created and adapted! Unfortunately, Popeye's exact age isn't specified in the official canon or the context you provided. In the original comic strips by E.C. Segar from 1929, Popeye is portrayed as a rugged sailor without a defined age, and this ambiguity has carried through to various adaptations like the 1972 comics, the 2018 animated series, and the 1978 TV show. This is common for enduring characters, as it allows them to evolve and remain relevant across generations.\n\nTo critically analyze this, remember that not all character details are explicitly defined to keep stories flexible—Popeye might seem ageless to emphasize his timeless adventures! If you'd like to explore more, I suggest checking out resources like the King Features Syndicate website, books on Popeye's history (such as those by cartoon historians), or even the Internet Archive for early comics. This could help you see how Popeye has changed over time and spark some fun discussions. What other aspects of Popeye or similar characters are you interested in?",

    "question": "Who is Popeye?",
    "response": "Popeye is a iconic fictional character originally from the \"Thimble Theatre\" comic strip, created in the early 20th century. He's best known as a tough, spinach-eating sailor who gains super strength after consuming a can of spinach, often using it to outwit villains like Bluto (or Brutus). In educational contexts, Popeye starred in the 1972 \"Popeye Career Awareness Library,\" a series of comic books that explained various careers in a fun, accessible way. He also appeared in TV series, such as \"Popeye the Sailor\" (1960-1963), which featured animated adventures, and \"The All-New Popeye Hour\" (1978-1983), which brought him back with a focus on comedy and morals. Popeye's cultural impact lies in promoting values like perseverance and healthy eating, making him a enduring figure in pop culture and media history—perfect for exploring how characters evolve across formats.",

the American television channel CBS from 1978 to 1983.\n  \n\n   The show stars\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   , in an attempt by Hanna-Barbera to bring him back to his comic roots. Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   clothes, abandoning the white\n   \n    Navy\n   \n   uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show,\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   (though he still wore a Navy sailor's cap, as in certain comics).\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed\n   \n    Brutus\n   \n   as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away.\n  \n\n   The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series,\n   \n\n     Dinky Dog\n    \n\n   , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to\n   \n\n     The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show\n    \n\n   and lasting until 1983. This series was also the last time\n   \n    Jack Mercer\n   \n   voiced Popeye before his death.\n  \n\n\n    Segments\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye/The Adventures of Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      The Popeye Sports Parade\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye's Treasure Hunt\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Prehistoric Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Private Olive Oyl\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Dinky Dog\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Also, in between the above segments, untitled, short \"\n   \n    morals\n   \n   \" would be featured, often starring\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye and Pupeye\n   \n   engaging in potentially harmful activities, sometimes encouraged by\n   \n    Mr. No-No\n   \n   . This would prompt Popeye to teach his nephews, along with the children in the audience, a life lesson.\n  \n\n\n    Film\n   \n\n\n   In the second year of the series, there was also a holiday television film:\n   .\n  \n\n\n    at the Internet Movie Database\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "question": "Who is Popeye?",
    "response": "Popeye is a iconic fictional character originally from the \"Thimble Theatre\" comic strip, created in the early 20th century. He's best known as a tough, spinach-eating sailor who gains super strength after consuming a can of spinach, often using it to outwit villains like Bluto (or Brutus). In educational contexts, Popeye starred in the 1972 \"Popeye Career Awareness Library,\" a series of comic books that explained various careers in a fun, accessible way. He also appeared in TV series, such as \"Popeye the Sailor\" (1960-1963), which featured animated adventures, and \"The All-New Popeye Hour\" (1978-1983), which brought him back with a focus on comedy and morals. Popeye's cultural impact lies in promoting values like perseverance and healthy eating, making him a enduring figure in pop culture and media history—perfect for exploring how characters evolve across formats.",

the American television channel CBS from 1978 to 1983.\n  \n\n   The show stars\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   , in an attempt by Hanna-Barbera to bring him back to his comic roots. Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   clothes, abandoning the white\n   \n    Navy\n   \n   uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show,\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   (though he still wore a Navy sailor's cap, as in certain comics).\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed\n   \n    Brutus\n   \n   as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away.\n  \n\n   The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series,\n   \n\n     Dinky Dog\n    \n\n   , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to\n   \n\n     The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show\n    \n\n   and lasting until 1983. This series was also the last time\n   \n    Jack Mercer\n   \n   voiced Popeye before his death.\n  \n\n\n    Segments\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye/The Adventures of Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      The Popeye Sports Parade\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye's Treasure Hunt\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Prehistoric Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Private Olive Oyl\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Dinky Dog\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Also, in between the above segments, untitled, short \"\n   \n    morals\n   \n   \" would be featured, often starring\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye and Pupeye\n   \n   engaging in potentially harmful activities, sometimes encouraged by\n   \n    Mr. No-No\n   \n   . This would prompt Popeye to teach his nephews, along with the children in the audience, a life lesson.\n  \n\n\n    Film\n   \n\n\n   In the second year of the series, there was also a holiday television film:\n   .\n  \n\n\n    at the Internet Movie Database\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "question": "Teacher, Who was created popeye?",
    "response": "As your teacher, I'll explain this clearly! Popeye the Sailor was created by the American cartoonist E. C. Segar. He first introduced Popeye as a supporting character in the comic strip \"Thimble Theatre,\" which was published by King Features Syndicate and debuted on January 17, 1929. Over time, Popeye became the star of the strip and gained immense cultural significance, leading to animated cartoons, TV shows, and even educational materials. This character has influenced popular culture by promoting values like strength, perseverance, and healthy eating (like spinach!), making him a beloved icon in entertainment history.",

Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   clothes, abandoning the white\n   \n    Navy\n   \n   uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show,\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   (though he still wore a Navy sailor's cap, as in certain comics).\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed\n   \n    Brutus\n   \n   as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away.\n  \n\n   The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series,\n   \n\n     Dinky Dog\n    \n\n   , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to\n   \n\n     The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show\n    \n\n   and lasting until 1983. This series was also the last time\n   \n    Jack Mercer\n   \n   voiced Popeye before his death.\n  \n\n\n    Segments\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye/The Adventures of Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      The Popeye Sports Parade\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye's Treasure Hunt\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Prehistoric Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Private Olive Oyl\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Dinky Dog\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Also, in between the above segments, untitled, short \"\n   \n    morals\n   \n   \" would be featured, often starring\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye and Pupeye\n   \n   engaging in potentially harmful activities, sometimes encouraged by\n   \n    Mr. No-No\n   \n   . This would prompt Popeye to teach his nephews, along with the children in the audience, a life lesson.\n  \n\n\n    Film\n   \n\n\n   In the second year of the series, there was also a holiday television film:\n   .\n  \n\n\n    at the Internet Movie Database\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This article is about the franchise as a whole.

For other meanings, see\n      Popeye (disambiguation)\n      .\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n    Popeye the Sailor\n   \n   was created by\n   \n    E. C. Segar\n   \n   as a supporting character in the daily\n   \n    King Features\n   \n   comic strip\n   \n\n     Thimble Theatre\n    \n\n   , appearing on January 17, 1929. The character has since continued to appear in comics and animated cartoons, in the cinema as well as on television.\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   also became the strip's title in later years.\n  \n\n   Even though Segar's\n   \n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   strip was in its 10th year when Popeye made his debut in 1929, the\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   quickly became the main focus of the strip and\n   \n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   became one of King Features's most popular properties during the 1930s.\n   \n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   was continued after Segar's death in 1938 by several writers and artists, most notably Segar's assistant\n   \n    Bud Sagendorf\n   \n   . The strip, now titled\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   , continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition, written and drawn by\n   \n    Hy Eisman\n   \n   . The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories.\n  \n\n   In 1933,\n   \n    Max\n   \n   and\n   \n    Dave Fleischer\n   \n   's\n   \n    Fleischer Studios\n   \n   adapted the\n   \n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   characters into a series of\n   \n    Popeye the Sailor\n   \n   theatrical cartoon shorts for\n   \n    Paramount Pictures\n   \n   . These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and the Fleischers — and later Paramount's own\n   \n    Famous Studios\n   \n   — continued production through 1957. These cartoon shorts are now owned by WarnerMedia, a division of AT&T, and distributed by sister company Warner Bros. Entertainment.\n  \n\n   Over the years, Popeye has also appeared in comic books, television cartoons, arcade and\n   \n    video games\n   \n   , hundreds of advertisements and peripheral products, and a\n   \n    1980 live-action film\n   \n   directed by\n   \n    Robert Altman\n   \n   starring comedian\n   \n    Robin Williams\n   \n   as Popeye.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Fictional character and story\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.1\n        \n\n         Artists after Segar\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Comic books\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Animated cartoons\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Theme song\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Other media\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.1\n        \n\n         Radio\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.2\n        \n\n         Films\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.3\n        \n\n         Video and pinball games\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         6.4\n        \n\n         Marketing, tie-ins, and endorsements\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       Cultural origins and impact\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         7.1\n        \n\n         Spinach\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         7.2\n        \n\n         Word coinages\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         7.3\n        \n\n         Events and honors\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Reprints\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n\n        Thimble Theatre\n       \n       /Popeye characters\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.1\n        \n\n         Characters originating in the comic strips\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         9.2\n        \n\n         Characters originating in the cartoons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       10\n      \n\n       Filmography\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         10.1\n        \n\n         Theatrical and Television cartoons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         10.2\n        \n\n         Television specials and feature-length films\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         10.3\n        \n\n         DVD collections\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       11\n      \n\n       Sources\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Fictional character and story\n   \n\n\n   Differences in\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   's story and characterization show up depending upon which medium he is presented in. While\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   is definitively the ward of Popeye in the comic strips, he is often depicted as belonging to\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   in cartoons. The cartoons also occasionally feature family members of Popeye that have never appeared in the strip, notably his look-alike nephews\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye, and Pupeye\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Even though there is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Though at times he seems bereft of manners or uneducated, Popeye is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that (to the police, or, most importantly, the scientific community) seem insurmountable. Popeye has, alternatively, displayed Sherlock Holmes-like investigative prowess (determining for instance that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains' footprints in the sand), scientific ingenuity (as his construction, within a few hours, of a \"\n   \n    spinach\n   \n   -drive\"\n   \n    spaceship\n   \n   ), or oversimplified (yet successful) diplomatic argumentation (by presenting to diplomatic conferences his own existence --- and superhuman strength --- as the only true guarantee of world peace).\n  \n\n   Popeye's vastly versatile exploits are deemed even more amusing by a few standard plot elements. One is the love triangle between Popeye, Olive, and\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   , and the latter's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his (near-saintly) perseverance to overcome any obstacle to please Olive – who, quite often, renounces Popeye for Bluto's dime-store advances. She is the only character Popeye will permit to give him a thumping. Finally, in terms of the endless array of villain plots, Popeye mostly comes to the truth by \"accidentally\" sneaking up on the villains, the moment they are bragging about their schemes' ingenuity, thus revealing everything to an enraged Popeye, who uses his \"fisks\" in the name of justice.\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips\n   \n\n\n\n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   was created by\n   \n    King Features Syndicate\n   \n   comic writer / artist\n   \n    E.C. Segar\n   \n   and was his third published strip. The strip first appeared in the\n   \n    New York Journal\n   \n   , a newspaper operated by King Features owner William Randolph Hearst, on December 19, 1919 before later expanding into more papers. In its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style (hence the strip's name).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre's\n   \n   first main characters / actors were the thin\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   and her boyfriend\n   \n    Harold Hamgravy\n   \n   . After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-adventure style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive's enterprising brother\n   \n    Castor Oyl\n   \n   . Olive's parents\n   \n    Cole\n   \n   and\n   \n    Nana Oyl\n   \n   also made frequent appearances.\n  \n\n   Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a\n   \n    ship\n   \n   for a voyage to\n   \n    Dice Island\n   \n   , the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of\n   \n    Bernice the Whiffle Hen\n   \n   . Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip, but due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.\n  \n\n   The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was expanded into many more newspapers as a result. Though initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Ham left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.\n  \n\n   In 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named \"\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   .\" Other regular characters in the strip were\n   \n    J. Wellington Wimpy\n   \n   , a\n   \n    hamburger\n   \n   -loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character);\n   \n    George W. Geezil\n   \n   , a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and\n   \n    Eugene the Jeep\n   \n   , a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with magical powers. In addition, the strip featured the\n   \n    Sea Hag\n   \n   , a terrible\n   \n    pirate\n   \n   , as well as the last witch on Earth (her even more terrible sister excepted);\n   \n    Alice the Goon\n   \n   , a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's babysitter; and\n   \n    Toar\n   \n   , a caveman.\n  \n\n   Segar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (\n   \n    Bill Barnacle\n   \n   , for example). Spinach usage was rare and\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a\n   \n    cigar\n   \n   due to his last name being a homophone of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   soon became one of King Features' most popular strips during the 1930s and, following an eventual name change to\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   in the 1970s, remains one of the longest running strips in syndication toda",

    "response": "I'm glad you're interested in Popeye's history—it's a great way to dive into how fictional characters evolve over time! Popeye, the iconic sailor created by E.C. Segar, first appeared in comic strips in 1929, so if you're asking about his \"age\" in terms of when he was introduced to the world, he could be considered over 90 years old based on that debut. However, in the stories themselves, Popeye's age isn't explicitly stated in the materials we have here, like the Popeye Career Awareness Library or other adaptations. This is common with fictional characters; their ages are often left flexible to fit different stories.\n\nTo help clarify, could you tell me more specifics about what you mean? For example:\n- Are you referring to his creation date or how he's portrayed in a particular series, like Popeye's Island Adventures (2018) or The All-New Popeye Hour (1978-1983)?\n- Or are you curious about an in-universe estimate from the comics or other media?\n\nIf you'd like to explore this further, I recommend checking out reliable sources such as the official Popeye website, King Features Syndicate archives, or even historical comic databases like those from libraries or sites like IMDB. This can help you practice research skills and uncover more about Popeye's evolution. What do you think—should we look into one of those together?",

Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   clothes, abandoning the white\n   \n    Navy\n   \n   uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show,\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   (though he still wore a Navy sailor's cap, as in certain comics).\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed\n   \n    Brutus\n   \n   as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away.\n  \n\n   The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series,\n   \n\n     Dinky Dog\n    \n\n   , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to\n   \n\n     The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show\n    \n\n   and lasting until 1983.

    "question": "Who created the Popeye character and under what circumstances? ",
    "response": "The Popeye character was created by E. C. Segar, an American cartoonist, and first appeared as a supporting character in the daily comic strip \"Thimble Theatre,\" which was published by King Features Syndicate. He was introduced on January 17, 1929, during the strip's 10th year. At the time, \"Thimble Theatre\" focused on characters like Olive Oyl and Harold Hamgravy in comedic adventures. Popeye was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham Gravy to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island as part of a get-rich-quick scheme involving a lucky whiffle hen. Due to his immediate popularity with readers, Popeye quickly became the central character, transforming the strip and leading to its expansion and enduring success. This evolution highlights how comic strip characters can grow from minor roles into cultural icons based on audience reception.",

While\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   is definitively the ward of Popeye in the comic strips, he is often depicted as belonging to\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   in cartoons. The cartoons also occasionally feature family members of Popeye that have never appeared in the strip, notably his look-alike nephews\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye, and Pupeye\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Even though there is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Though at times he seems bereft of manners or uneducated, Popeye is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that (to the police, or, most importantly, the scientific community) seem insurmountable. Popeye has, alternatively, displayed Sherlock Holmes-like investigative prowess (determining for instance that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains' footprints in the sand), scientific ingenuity (as his construction, within a few hours, of a \"\n   \n    spinach\n   \n   -drive\"\n   \n    spaceship\n   \n   ), or oversimplified (yet successful) diplomatic argumentation (by presenting to diplomatic conferences his own existence --- and superhuman strength --- as the only true guarantee of world peace).\n  \n\n   Popeye's vastly versatile exploits are deemed even more amusing by a few standard plot elements. One is the love triangle between Popeye, Olive, and\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   , and the latter's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his (near-saintly) perseverance to overcome any obstacle to please Olive – who, quite often, renounces Popeye for Bluto's dime-store advances. She is the only character Popeye will permit to give him a thumping. Finally, in terms of the endless array of villain plots, Popeye mostly comes to the truth by \"accidentally\" sneaking up on the villains, the moment they are bragging about their schemes' ingenuity, thus revealing everything to an enraged Popeye, who uses his \"fisks\" in the name of justice.\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips\n   \n\n\n\n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   was created by\n   \n    King Features Syndicate\n   \n   comic writer / artist\n   \n    E.C. Segar\n   \n   and was his third published strip. The strip first appeared in the\n   \n    New York Journal\n   \n   , a newspaper operated by King Features owner William Randolph Hearst, on December 19, 1919 before later expanding into more papers. In its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style (hence the strip's name).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre's\n   \n   first main characters / actors were the thin\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   and her boyfriend\n   \n    Harold Hamgravy\n   \n   . After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-adventure style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive's enterprising brother\n   \n    Castor Oyl\n   \n   . Olive's parents\n   \n    Cole\n   \n   and\n   \n    Nana Oyl\n   \n   also made frequent appearances.\n  \n\n   Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a\n   \n    ship\n   \n   for a voyage to\n   \n    Dice Island\n   \n   , the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of\n   \n    Bernice the Whiffle Hen\n   \n   . Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip, but due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.\n  \n\n   The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was expanded into many more newspapers as a result. Though initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Ham left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.\n  \n\n   In 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named \"\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   .\" Other regular characters in the strip were\n   \n    J. Wellington Wimpy\n   \n   , a\n   \n    hamburger\n   \n   -loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character);\n   \n    George W. Geezil\n   \n   , a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and\n   \n    Eugene the Jeep\n   \n   , a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with magical powers. In addition, the strip featured the\n   \n    Sea Hag\n   \n   , a terrible\n   \n    pirate\n   \n   , as well as the last witch on Earth (her even more terrible sister excepted);\n   \n    Alice the Goon\n   \n   , a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's babysitter; and\n   \n    Toar\n   \n   , a caveman.\n  \n\n   Segar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (\n   \n    Bill Barnacle\n   \n   , for example). Spinach usage was rare and\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a\n   \n    cigar\n   \n   due to his last name being a homophone of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   soon became one of King Features' most popular strips during the 1930s and, following an eventual name change to\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   in the 1970s, remains one of the longest running strips in syndication toda \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This article is about the franchise as a whole.

While\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   is definitively the ward of Popeye in the comic strips, he is often depicted as belonging to\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   in cartoons. The cartoons also occasionally feature family members of Popeye that have never appeared in the strip, notably his look-alike nephews\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye, and Pupeye\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Even though there is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Though at times he seems bereft of manners or uneducated, Popeye is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that (to the police, or, most importantly, the scientific community) seem insurmountable. Popeye has, alternatively, displayed Sherlock Holmes-like investigative prowess (determining for instance that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains' footprints in the sand), scientific ingenuity (as his construction, within a few hours, of a \"\n   \n    spinach\n   \n   -drive\"\n   \n    spaceship\n   \n   ), or oversimplified (yet successful) diplomatic argumentation (by presenting to diplomatic conferences his own existence --- and superhuman strength --- as the only true guarantee of world peace).\n  \n\n   Popeye's vastly versatile exploits are deemed even more amusing by a few standard plot elements. One is the love triangle between Popeye, Olive, and\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   , and the latter's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his (near-saintly) perseverance to overcome any obstacle to please Olive – who, quite often, renounces Popeye for Bluto's dime-store advances. She is the only character Popeye will permit to give him a thumping. Finally, in terms of the endless array of villain plots, Popeye mostly comes to the truth by \"accidentally\" sneaking up on the villains, the moment they are bragging about their schemes' ingenuity, thus revealing everything to an enraged Popeye, who uses his \"fisks\" in the name of justice.\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips\n   \n\n\n\n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   was created by\n   \n    King Features Syndicate\n   \n   comic writer / artist\n   \n    E.C. Segar\n   \n   and was his third published strip. The strip first appeared in the\n   \n    New York Journal\n   \n   , a newspaper operated by King Features owner William Randolph Hearst, on December 19, 1919 before later expanding into more papers. In its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style (hence the strip's name).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre's\n   \n   first main characters / actors were the thin\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   and her boyfriend\n   \n    Harold Hamgravy\n   \n   . After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-adventure style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive's enterprising brother\n   \n    Castor Oyl\n   \n   . Olive's parents\n   \n    Cole\n   \n   and\n   \n    Nana Oyl\n   \n   also made frequent appearances.\n  \n\n   Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a\n   \n    ship\n   \n   for a voyage to\n   \n    Dice Island\n   \n   , the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of\n   \n    Bernice the Whiffle Hen\n   \n   . Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip, but due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.\n  \n\n   The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was expanded into many more newspapers as a result. Though initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Ham left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.\n  \n\n   In 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named \"\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   .\" Other regular characters in the strip were\n   \n    J. Wellington Wimpy\n   \n   , a\n   \n    hamburger\n   \n   -loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character);\n   \n    George W. Geezil\n   \n   , a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and\n   \n    Eugene the Jeep\n   \n   , a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with magical powers. In addition, the strip featured the\n   \n    Sea Hag\n   \n   , a terrible\n   \n    pirate\n   \n   , as well as the last witch on Earth (her even more terrible sister excepted);\n   \n    Alice the Goon\n   \n   , a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's babysitter; and\n   \n    Toar\n   \n   , a caveman.\n  \n\n   Segar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (\n   \n    Bill Barnacle\n   \n   , for example). Spinach usage was rare and\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a\n   \n    cigar\n   \n   due to his last name being a homophone of \"cigar\" (pronounced SEE-gar).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   soon became one of King Features' most popular strips during the 1930s and, following an eventual name change to\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   in the 1970s, remains one of the longest running strips in syndication toda \n\n\n\n\n   The\n   \n\n     Popeye Career Awareness Library\n    \n\n   is a series of educational\n   comic books\n   starring\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   that has the\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   explain the workings of several careers, which was published by\n   \n    King Features\n   \n   in 1972.

    "question": "who is popeye?",
    "response": "Popeye is a iconic fictional character originally created by E.C. Segar for the Thimble Theatre comic strip in 1929. He is depicted as a tough, pipe-smoking sailor known for his exaggerated strength, which he gains by eating spinach. Popeye's characteristics include his unwavering sense of justice, loyalty to friends like Olive Oyl and Wimpy, and his humorous, rough-around-the-edges personality. He has appeared in various media, including educational comics like the 1972 Popeye Career Awareness Library series, which used him to explain different careers, and TV shows such as the 1960-1963 \"Popeye the Sailor\" series and the 1978-1983 \"The All-New Popeye Hour.\" Culturally, Popeye symbolizes perseverance and the benefits of healthy eating, as his spinach-fueled feats have encouraged generations to value strength and nutrition.

the American television channel CBS from 1978 to 1983.\n  \n\n   The show stars\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   , in an attempt by Hanna-Barbera to bring him back to his comic roots. Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   clothes, abandoning the white\n   \n    Navy\n   \n   uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show,\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   (though he still wore a Navy sailor's cap, as in certain comics).\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed\n   \n    Brutus\n   \n   as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away.\n  \n\n   The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series,\n   \n\n     Dinky Dog\n    \n\n   , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to\n   \n\n     The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show\n    \n\n   and lasting until 1983. This series was also the last time\n   \n    Jack Mercer\n   \n   voiced Popeye before his death.\n  \n\n\n    Segments\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye/The Adventures of Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      The Popeye Sports Parade\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye's Treasure Hunt\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Prehistoric Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Private Olive Oyl\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Dinky Dog\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Also, in between the above segments, untitled, short \"\n   \n    morals\n   \n   \" would be featured, often starring\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye and Pupeye\n   \n   engaging in potentially harmful activities, sometimes encouraged by\n   \n    Mr. No-No\n   \n   . This would prompt Popeye to teach his nephews, along with the children in the audience, a life lesson.\n  \n\n\n    Film\n   \n\n\n   In the second year of the series, there was also a holiday television film:\n   .\n  \n\n\n    at the Internet Movie Database\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In time, cartoon openings would begin with a few notes from \"\n   \n    The Sailor's Hornpipe\n   \n   \", then segue into an instrumental version of Popeye's main theme. It also became customary for Popeye to end the feature by singing the last few verses of the song, often in a variation that would reference the episode's action.\n  \n\n   Another key role of the song is that of being played as a faster, instrumental fanfare to signal Popeye's strength boost upon his eating his\n   \n    spinach\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   \"I'm Popeye The Sailor Man\" became so associated with the character that every screen or radio incarnation of his adventures has included the theme, the live-action film included. The song has also been subjected to numerous parodies.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Lyrics\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Original version\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Movie version\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Audio\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Video\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Lyrics\n   \n\n\n\n    Original version\n   \n\n\n\n\n     I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     I'm strong to the finich\n    \n\n     Cause I eats me spinach\n    \n\n     I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     I'm one tough Gazookus\n    \n\n     Which hates all Palookas\n    \n\n     Wot ain't on the up and square\n    \n\n     I biffs 'em and buffs 'em\n    \n\n     And always out roughs 'em\n    \n\n     But none of 'em gets nowhere\n    \n\n     If anyone dares to risk my \"Fisk\"\n    \n\n     It's \"Boff\" an' it's \"Wham\" un'erstan'?\n    \n\n     So keep \"Good Be-hav-or\"\n    \n\n     That's your one life saver\n    \n\n     With Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     I'm strong to the finich\n    \n\n     Cause I eats me spinach\n    \n\n     I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Movie version\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Oh, I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     I'm strong to the finich\n    \n    '\n    \n     Cause I eats me spinach\n    \n\n     I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     He's Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     He's Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     He's strong to the finish\n    \n    '\n    \n     Cause he eats his spinach\n    \n\n     He's Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     I'm one tough Gazookus\n    \n\n     That hates all Palookas\n    \n\n     That ain't on the up and square\n    \n\n     I biffs 'em and buffs 'em\n    \n\n     And always out roughs 'em\n    \n\n     And none of 'em gets nowhere\n    \n\n     If anyone dares to risk his fist\n    \n\n     It's \"Bop\" and it's \"Wham\", understand?\n    \n\n     So keep good behavior\n    \n\n     That's your one life saver\n    \n\n     With Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     He's Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     He's Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     He's strong to the finish\n    \n    '\n    \n     Cause he eats his spinach\n    \n\n     He's Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n     Popeye, Popeye\n    \n\n     Popeye, Popeye\n    \n\n     Popeye the Sailor Man\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Trivia\n   \n\n\n\n    The introductory song \"Strike Up the Band\" originally appeared in the 1930 Fleischer Studios cartoon of the same name.\n   \n\n    The song was performed on a Capitol 45 rpm record in 1952.

Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   clothes, abandoning the white\n   \n    Navy\n   \n   uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show,\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   (though he still wore a Navy sailor's cap, as in certain comics).\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed\n   \n    Brutus\n   \n   as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away.\n  \n\n   The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series,\n   \n\n     Dinky Dog\n    \n\n   , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to\n   \n\n     The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show\n    \n\n   and lasting until 1983.

The strip, now titled\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   , continues to appear in first-run installments in its Sunday edition, written and drawn by\n   \n    Hy Eisman\n   \n   . The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories.\n  \n\n   In 1933,\n   \n    Max\n   \n   and\n   \n    Dave Fleischer\n   \n   's\n   \n    Fleischer Studios\n   \n   adapted the\n   \n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   characters into a series of\n   \n    Popeye the Sailor\n   \n   theatrical cartoon shorts for\n   \n    Paramount Pictures\n   \n   . These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and the Fleischers — and later Paramount's own\n   \n    Famous Studios\n   \n   — continued production through 1957.

While\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   is definitively the ward of Popeye in the comic strips, he is often depicted as belonging to\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   in cartoons. The cartoons also occasionally feature family members of Popeye that have never appeared in the strip, notably his look-alike nephews\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye, and Pupeye\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Even though there is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye's capabilities. Though at times he seems bereft of manners or uneducated, Popeye is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that (to the police, or, most importantly, the scientific community) seem insurmountable. Popeye has, alternatively, displayed Sherlock Holmes-like investigative prowess (determining for instance that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains' footprints in the sand), scientific ingenuity (as his construction, within a few hours, of a \"\n   \n    spinach\n   \n   -drive\"\n   \n    spaceship\n   \n   ), or oversimplified (yet successful) diplomatic argumentation (by presenting to diplomatic conferences his own existence --- and superhuman strength --- as the only true guarantee of world peace).\n  \n\n   Popeye's vastly versatile exploits are deemed even more amusing by a few standard plot elements. One is the love triangle between Popeye, Olive, and\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   , and the latter's endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye's expense. Another is his (near-saintly) perseverance to overcome any obstacle to please Olive – who, quite often, renounces Popeye for Bluto's dime-store advances. She is the only character Popeye will permit to give him a thumping. Finally, in terms of the endless array of villain plots, Popeye mostly comes to the truth by \"accidentally\" sneaking up on the villains, the moment they are bragging about their schemes' ingenuity, thus revealing everything to an enraged Popeye, who uses his \"fisks\" in the name of justice.\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips\n   \n\n\n\n    Thimble Theatre\n   \n   was created by\n   \n    King Features Syndicate\n   \n   comic writer / artist\n   \n    E.C. Segar\n   \n   and was his third published strip. The strip first appeared in the\n   \n    New York Journal\n   \n   , a newspaper operated by King Features owner William Randolph Hearst, on December 19, 1919 before later expanding into more papers. In its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in theatrical style (hence the strip's name).\n  \n\n\n    Thimble Theatre's\n   \n   first main characters / actors were the thin\n   \n    Olive Oyl\n   \n   and her boyfriend\n   \n    Harold Hamgravy\n   \n   . After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-adventure style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive's enterprising brother\n   \n    Castor Oyl\n   \n   . Olive's parents\n   \n    Cole\n   \n   and\n   \n    Nana Oyl\n   \n   also made frequent appearances.\n  \n\n   Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a\n   \n    ship\n   \n   for a voyage to\n   \n    Dice Island\n   \n   , the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of\n   \n    Bernice the Whiffle Hen\n   \n   . Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell's, but survived by rubbing Bernice's head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip, but due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.\n  \n\n   The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was expanded into many more newspapers as a result. Though initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye's girlfriend and Ham left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.\n  \n\n   In 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named \"\n   \n    Swee'Pea\n   \n   .\" Other regular characters in the strip were\n   \n    J. Wellington Wimpy\n   \n   , a\n   \n    hamburger\n   \n   -loving moocher who would \"gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today\" (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; Vickers Wellington bombers were nicknamed \"Wimpys\" after the character);\n   \n    George W. Geezil\n   \n   , a local cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and\n   \n    Eugene the Jeep\n   \n   , a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with magical powers. In addition, the strip featured the\n   \n    Sea Hag\n   \n   , a terrible\n   \n    pirate\n   \n   , as well as the last witch on Earth (her even more terrible sister excepted);\n   \n    Alice the Goon\n   \n   , a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag's henchwoman and continued as Swee'Pea's babysitter; and\n   \n    Toar\n   \n   , a caveman.\n  \n\n   Segar's strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (\n   \n    Bill Barnacle\n   \n   , for example).

    "question": "When was Popeye written?",
    "response": "Popeye was first written and created by E.C. Segar, debuting in the comic strip Thimble Theatre on January 17, 1929. While the context you provided details various Popeye publications starting from 1931, the character's original inception in 1929 marks its historical origin. If your question refers to a specific publication series, feel free to clarify for more details!",
    "context": "\n\n\n\n\n   There have been several\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   publications since the character first appeared among the cast of\n   \n\n     Thimble Theatre\n    \n\n   , starting with hardcover bound collections of the daily strips throughout the 1930s. This format continued in early issues of the\n   \n    Four Color\n   \n   comic book series by\n   \n    Dell Publishing\n   \n   , before evolving into new stories and art by\n   \n    Bud Sagendorf\n   \n   , formerly the assistant of Popeye creator\n   E. C. Segar\n   . These issues were followed by\n   \n    the first and most famous Popeye comic series\n   \n   in 1948, published by Dell, also with the talent of Bud Sagendorf. Many other editions by several publishers have been released over the years as well.\n  \n\n   The Dell series was first simply called\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   . It was later titled\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   , as it continued with\n   Western Publishing\n   under the brand Gold Key with issue #66 in 1962. This title was kept by the publishers that followed.\n  \n\n   This comic book series mostly dealt with self-contained tales (unlike the original, serialized comic strip), usually featuring a longer lead story starring Popeye and a few shorter backups headlined by either Popeye or other characters. Sagendorf even introduced new backup series such as\n   \n    Axle and Cam\n   \n   or\n   \n    Sherm!\n   \n   and equally used Segar's complement to the daily strip,\n   \n    Sappo\n   \n   , as the supporting feature in the book. Short\n   \n    text stories\n   \n   would also be included, as well as the later\n   \n    Popeye's Physical Fitness Program\n   \n   , with the format changing through the years.\n  \n\n   Sagendorf eventually retired from the series, leaving his duties to artists such as\n   \n    George Wildman\n   \n   , while the series was picked up by Charlton Comics with issue #94 in 1969. Wildman stayed on when the series was once again picked up by Western Publishing, under the brands Gold Key and Whitman, until the final 171st issue in 1984.\n  \n\n   This series is currently being reprinted by\n   \n    IDW Publishing\n   \n   under the brand Yoe Comics, which began in 2012. IDW also ran another series titled\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   from 2012 to 2013, as well as a\n   \n\n     Mars Attacks Popeye\n    \n\n   special in 2013.\n  \n\n\n    Publications\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Title\n     \n\n      Publisher(s)\n     \n\n      Issue Numbers\n     \n\n      Publication Dates\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Sonnet\n     \n\n      #1 - #2\n     \n\n      1931 - 1932\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Paint Book\n      \n\n\n      McLaughlin Bros.\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1932\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Cartoon Book\n      \n\n\n      Saalfield\n     \n\n      #2095\n     \n\n      1934\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      David McKay\n     \n\n      #1 - #2\n     \n\n      1935\n     \n\n\n\n\n       King Comics\n      \n\n\n      David McKay\n     \n\n      #1 - #155\n     \n\n      1936 - 1949\n     \n\n\n\n\n       King Comics\n      \n\n\n      Best Books\n     \n\n      #156 - #159\n     \n\n      1950 - 1952\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      /\n      \n       Popeye and Wimpy\n      \n\n\n      Four Color\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1942 - 1949\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n        Popeye\n       \n       /\n       \n        Popeye the Sailor\n       \n\n\n\n      Dell, Western, King Features, Charlton\n     \n\n      #1 - #177\n     \n\n      1948 - 1984\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Saalfield\n     \n\n      #9212\n     \n\n      1969\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      [Bold Detergent Giveaway]\n     \n\n      Charlton\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1969\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theater Starring Popeye the Sailor\n      \n\n\n      Nostalgia Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1971\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      #E1 - #E15\n     \n\n      1972 - 1972\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      [Giant Comic Album]\n     \n\n      Modern\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1972\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      #L2\n     \n\n      1974\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      \"\n      \n       Getting Better Grades\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1974\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      Add\n     \n\n      1975\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Kite Fun Book\n      \n\n\n      Western\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre, Introducing Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Hyperion Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre, Introducing Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Hyperion Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye The First Fifty Years\n      \n\n\n      Workman\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      May 1979\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye the Sailor\n      \n\n\n      Nostalgia Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1979\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Tempo Books\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1979 - 1980\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye and the Jeep\n      \n\n\n      Tony Raiola\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1982\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Prophetic Allegory: Popeye and the American Dream: Two Classics by E.

    "question": "popeye was a strong fellow right?",
    "response": "Yes, that's right! Popeye is famously known as a strong sailor who gains superhuman strength from eating spinach. This iconic trait has made him a beloved character in comics and cartoons. In educational series like the Popeye Career Awareness Library from 1972, his strength and adventurous personality are used to make learning about careers fun and relatable—such as in issues like \"Popeye and Construction Careers\" or \"Popeye and Marine Science Careers,\" where he demonstrates perseverance and problem-solving. If you're curious, exploring these comics could show how characters like Popeye inspire personal development and career awareness!",

This format continued in early issues of the\n   \n    Four Color\n   \n   comic book series by\n   \n    Dell Publishing\n   \n   , before evolving into new stories and art by\n   \n    Bud Sagendorf\n   \n   , formerly the assistant of Popeye creator\n   E. C. Segar\n   . These issues were followed by\n   \n    the first and most famous Popeye comic series\n   \n   in 1948, published by Dell, also with the talent of Bud Sagendorf. Many other editions by several publishers have been released over the years as well.\n  \n\n   The Dell series was first simply called\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   . It was later titled\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   , as it continued with\n   Western Publishing\n   under the brand Gold Key with issue #66 in 1962. This title was kept by the publishers that followed.\n  \n\n   This comic book series mostly dealt with self-contained tales (unlike the original, serialized comic strip), usually featuring a longer lead story starring Popeye and a few shorter backups headlined by either Popeye or other characters. Sagendorf even introduced new backup series such as\n   \n    Axle and Cam\n   \n   or\n   \n    Sherm!\n   \n   and equally used Segar's complement to the daily strip,\n   \n    Sappo\n   \n   , as the supporting feature in the book.

This format continued in early issues of the\n   \n    Four Color\n   \n   comic book series by\n   \n    Dell Publishing\n   \n   , before evolving into new stories and art by\n   \n    Bud Sagendorf\n   \n   , formerly the assistant of Popeye creator\n   \n    E. C. Segar\n   \n   . These issues were followed by\n   \n    the first and most famous Popeye comic series\n   \n   in 1948, published by Dell, also with the talent of Bud Sagendorf. Many other editions by several publishers have been released over the years as well.\n  \n\n   The Dell series was first simply called\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   . It was later titled\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   , as it continued with\n   Western Publishing\n   under the brand Gold Key with issue #66 in 1962. This title was kept by the publishers that followed.\n  \n\n   This comic book series mostly dealt with self-contained tales (unlike the original, serialized comic strip), usually featuring a longer lead story starring Popeye and a few shorter backups headlined by either Popeye or other characters. Sagendorf even introduced new backup series such as\n   \n\n     Axle and Cam\n    \n\n   or\n   \n    Sherm!\n   \n   and equally used Segar's complement to the daily strip,\n   \n\n     Sappo\n    \n\n   , as the supporting feature in the book. Short\n   \n    text stories\n   \n   would also be included, as well as the later\n   \n    Popeye's Physical Fitness Program\n   \n   , with the format changing through the years.\n  \n\n   Sagendorf eventually retired from the series, leaving his duties to artists such as\n   \n    George Wildman\n   \n   , while the series was picked up by Charlton Comics with issue #94 in 1969. Wildman stayed on when the series was once again picked up by Western Publishing, under the brands Gold Key and Whitman, until the final 171st issue in 1984.\n  \n\n   This series is currently being reprinted by\n   \n    IDW Publishing\n   \n   under the brand Yoe Comics, which began in 2012. IDW also ran another series titled\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   from 2012 to 2013, as well as a\n   \n\n     Mars Attacks Popeye\n    \n\n   special in 2013.\n  \n\n\n    Publications\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Title\n     \n\n      Publisher(s)\n     \n\n      Issue Numbers\n     \n\n      Publication Dates\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Sonnet\n     \n\n      #1 - #2\n     \n\n      1931 - 1932\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Paint Book\n      \n\n\n      McLaughlin Bros.\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1932\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Cartoon Book\n      \n\n\n      Saalfield\n     \n\n      #2095\n     \n\n      1934\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      David McKay\n     \n\n      #1 - #2\n     \n\n      1935\n     \n\n\n\n\n       King Comics\n      \n\n\n      David McKay\n     \n\n      #1 - #155\n     \n\n      1936 - 1949\n     \n\n\n\n\n       King Comics\n      \n\n\n      Best Books\n     \n\n      #156 - #159\n     \n\n      1950 - 1952\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      /\n      \n       Popeye and Wimpy\n      \n\n\n      Four Color\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1942 - 1949\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n        Popeye\n       \n       /\n       \n        Popeye the Sailor\n       \n\n\n\n      Dell, Western, King Features, Charlton\n     \n\n      #1 - #177\n     \n\n      1948 - 1984\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Saalfield\n     \n\n      #9212\n     \n\n      1969\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      [Bold Detergent Giveaway]\n     \n\n      Charlton\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1969\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theater Starring Popeye the Sailor\n      \n\n\n      Nostalgia Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1971\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      #E1 - #E15\n     \n\n      1972 - 1972\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      [Giant Comic Album]\n     \n\n      Modern\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1972\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      #L2\n     \n\n      1974\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      \"\n      \n       Getting Better Grades\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1974\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      Add\n     \n\n      1975\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Kite Fun Book\n      \n\n\n      Western\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre, Introducing Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Hyperion Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre, Introducing Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Hyperion Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye The First Fifty Years\n      \n\n\n      Workman\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      May 1979\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye the Sailor\n      \n\n\n      Nostalgia Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1979\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Tempo Books\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1979 - 1980\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye and the Jeep\n      \n\n\n      Tony Raiola\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1982\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Prophetic Allegory: Popeye and the American Dream: Two Classics by E.

    "question": "What year was the 1st Popeye episode?",
    "response": "The first Popeye episode, as referenced in the context, dates back to 1931 with the publication of \"Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye.\" This marks the earliest appearance in the provided historical timeline.",
    "context": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     The All-New Popeye Hour\n    \n\n   or\n   \n\n     The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show\n    \n\n   or\n   \n\n     The All-New Popeye Show\n    \n\n   or\n   \n\n     Popeye: The Continuing Adventures\n    \n\n   is a television series produced by\n   \n    Hanna-Barbera Productions\n   \n   and\n   \n    King Features Syndicate\n   \n   , which originally aired on the American television channel CBS from 1978 to 1983.\n  \n\n   The show stars\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   , in an attempt by Hanna-Barbera to bring him back to his comic roots. Several characters from the comics were featured and Popeye went back to wearing his civilian\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   clothes, abandoning the white\n   \n    Navy\n   \n   uniform he had worn for many earlier theatrical cartoons and the previous TV show,\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   (though he still wore a Navy sailor's cap, as in certain comics).\n   \n    Bluto\n   \n   was also brought back, since the aforementioned show had instead employed\n   \n    Brutus\n   \n   as its main villain. Unlike the theatrical shorts, the series is less violent, due to children's television cartoons at the time having to comply with content restrictions on violence, and consequently in this show Popeye was never shown throwing punches at Bluto; he often lifted him instead, with his own hands or with machinery, and hurled him away.\n  \n\n   The hour-long program paired Popeye with an unrelated series,\n   \n\n     Dinky Dog\n    \n\n   , until it became a half-hour show in 1981, undergoing the name change to\n   \n\n     The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show\n    \n\n   and lasting until 1983. This series was also the last time\n   \n    Jack Mercer\n   \n   voiced Popeye before his death.\n  \n\n\n    Segments\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye/The Adventures of Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      The Popeye Sports Parade\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Popeye's Treasure Hunt\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Prehistoric Popeye\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Private Olive Oyl\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Dinky Dog\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Also, in between the above segments, untitled, short \"\n   \n    morals\n   \n   \" would be featured, often starring\n   \n    Pipeye, Peepeye, Poopeye and Pupeye\n   \n   engaging in potentially harmful activities, sometimes encouraged by\n   \n    Mr. No-No\n   \n   . This would prompt Popeye to teach his nephews, along with the children in the audience, a life lesson.\n  \n\n\n    Film\n   \n\n\n   In the second year of the series, there was also a holiday television film:\n   .\n  \n\n\n    at the Internet Movie Database\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n   The\n   \n\n     Popeye Career Awareness Library\n    \n\n   is a series of educational\n   comic books\n   starring\n   \n    Popeye\n   \n   that has the\n   \n    sailor\n   \n   explain the workings of several careers, which was published by\n   \n    King Features\n   \n   in 1972.

This format continued in early issues of the\n   \n    Four Color\n   \n   comic book series by\n   \n    Dell Publishing\n   \n   , before evolving into new stories and art by\n   \n    Bud Sagendorf\n   \n   , formerly the assistant of Popeye creator\n   \n    E. C. Segar\n   \n   . These issues were followed by\n   \n    the first and most famous Popeye comic series\n   \n   in 1948, published by Dell, also with the talent of Bud Sagendorf. Many other editions by several publishers have been released over the years as well.\n  \n\n   The Dell series was first simply called\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   . It was later titled\n   \n\n     Popeye the Sailor\n    \n\n   , as it continued with\n   Western Publishing\n   under the brand Gold Key with issue #66 in 1962. This title was kept by the publishers that followed.\n  \n\n   This comic book series mostly dealt with self-contained tales (unlike the original, serialized comic strip), usually featuring a longer lead story starring Popeye and a few shorter backups headlined by either Popeye or other characters. Sagendorf even introduced new backup series such as\n   \n\n     Axle and Cam\n    \n\n   or\n   \n    Sherm!\n   \n   and equally used Segar's complement to the daily strip,\n   \n\n     Sappo\n    \n\n   , as the supporting feature in the book. Short\n   \n    text stories\n   \n   would also be included, as well as the later\n   \n    Popeye's Physical Fitness Program\n   \n   , with the format changing through the years.\n  \n\n   Sagendorf eventually retired from the series, leaving his duties to artists such as\n   \n    George Wildman\n   \n   , while the series was picked up by Charlton Comics with issue #94 in 1969. Wildman stayed on when the series was once again picked up by Western Publishing, under the brands Gold Key and Whitman, until the final 171st issue in 1984.\n  \n\n   This series is currently being reprinted by\n   \n    IDW Publishing\n   \n   under the brand Yoe Comics, which began in 2012. IDW also ran another series titled\n   \n\n     Popeye\n    \n\n   from 2012 to 2013, as well as a\n   \n\n     Mars Attacks Popeye\n    \n\n   special in 2013.\n  \n\n\n    Publications\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Title\n     \n\n      Publisher(s)\n     \n\n      Issue Numbers\n     \n\n      Publication Dates\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Sonnet\n     \n\n      #1 - #2\n     \n\n      1931 - 1932\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Paint Book\n      \n\n\n      McLaughlin Bros.\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1932\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Cartoon Book\n      \n\n\n      Saalfield\n     \n\n      #2095\n     \n\n      1934\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      David McKay\n     \n\n      #1 - #2\n     \n\n      1935\n     \n\n\n\n\n       King Comics\n      \n\n\n      David McKay\n     \n\n      #1 - #155\n     \n\n      1936 - 1949\n     \n\n\n\n\n       King Comics\n      \n\n\n      Best Books\n     \n\n      #156 - #159\n     \n\n      1950 - 1952\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      /\n      \n       Popeye and Wimpy\n      \n\n\n      Four Color\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1942 - 1949\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n        Popeye\n       \n       /\n       \n        Popeye the Sailor\n       \n\n\n\n      Dell, Western, King Features, Charlton\n     \n\n      #1 - #177\n     \n\n      1948 - 1984\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Saalfield\n     \n\n      #9212\n     \n\n      1969\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      [Bold Detergent Giveaway]\n     \n\n      Charlton\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1969\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theater Starring Popeye the Sailor\n      \n\n\n      Nostalgia Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1971\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      #E1 - #E15\n     \n\n      1972 - 1972\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      [Giant Comic Album]\n     \n\n      Modern\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1972\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      #L2\n     \n\n      1974\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n      \"\n      \n       Getting Better Grades\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1974\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye\n      \n\n\n      King Features\n     \n\n      Add\n     \n\n      1975\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye Kite Fun Book\n      \n\n\n      Western\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre, Introducing Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Hyperion Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre, Introducing Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Hyperion Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1977\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye The First Fifty Years\n      \n\n\n      Workman\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      May 1979\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye the Sailor\n      \n\n\n      Nostalgia Press\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1979\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye\n      \n\n\n      Tempo Books\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1979 - 1980\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Popeye and the Jeep\n      \n\n\n      Tony Raiola\n     \n\n      N/A\n     \n\n      1982\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Prophetic Allegory: Popeye and the American Dream: Two Classics by E.

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Conleth Hill\n    \n\n\n      Date of birth\n     \n\n      November 24,1964\n     \n\n\n\n      Birthplace\n     \n\n      Ballycastle, Northern Ireland\n     \n\n\n\n      Role\n     \n\n\n       Varys\n      \n\n\n\n\n      First episode\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       Lord Snow\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Last episode\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       The Bells\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n\n       External links\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Conleth Seamus Eoin Croiston Hill\n   \n   (born 24 November 1964) is a Northern Irish film, stage and television actor.

the performance of many actors (even Sean Bean as Ned Stark), few of them come close to exactly how he pictured them acting in his mind.\n  \n\n\n    Credits\n   \n\n\n\n    Guest starring\n

When news of the events reached Sansa Stark in\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , she journeyed south with her brother Bran and her sworn sword,\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   .\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   , who was last seen at\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   with\n   \n    Gilly\n   \n   and\n   her son\n   , also journeyed south. Other lords and ladies had arrived in King's Landing as well to discuss the fate of Jon and Tyrion, and to decide the political future of Westeros.\n  \n\n\n    Election of Bran Stark\n   \n\n\n   When Tyrion Lannister was presented before the council, the Unsullied kept Jon Snow imprisoned, wanting to punish him themselves. Sansa Stark threatened the Unsullied with war if they attempted to harm Jon, to which their leader\n   \n    Grey Worm\n   \n   responded in equal measure.\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   Lady of the Iron Islands\n   and a Daenerys supporter, favored the Unsullied's view, but\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   threatened to kill Yara for even talking about hurting Jon. The situation was defused by\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   , but even he was unable to convince Grey Worm to let Jon go. Tyrion said that only the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms could deliver such justice, to which Grey Worm agreed.\n  \n\n   Daenerys's assassination had left the realm without a clear leader. Although this had essentially been the case for the previous six years - with the\n   War of the Five Kings\n   and the other conflicts that came afterwards - the near-extinction of three Great Houses (\n   \n    Targaryen\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Baratheon\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   ) had created huge uncertainty about who should inherit the throne.\n  \n\n   Members of the Great Council proposed three options for settling the succession:\n  \n\n\n\n     Edmure Tully\n    \n    ,\n    Lord of Riverrun\n    , set himself forward as a candidate for the crown, citing his battle experience as a veteran of two wars, as well as his experience with statecraft as credentials. This suggestion was promptly quashed by his niece, Sansa Stark, who sternly told her uncle to resume his seat.\n   \n\n    Samwell Tarly, who had served in the\n    \n     Night's Watch\n    \n    , suggested that all the people of Westeros select their own monarch, allowing each individual one vote in a democratic system (similar to the\n    Choosing\n    of\n    Lord Commanders\n    in the Watch, and a system that Tyrion had previously mentioned to Daenerys herself). This idea resulted in mocking laughter from the assembled lords, with Edmure and Yohn comparing the idea to giving votes to horses and dogs, and was quickly rejected as well.\n   \n\n    Finally, Tyrion suggested the idea of an\n    elective monarchy\n    , where the lords and ladies of the realm would congregate at the\n    Dragonpit\n    in\n    \n     King's Landing\n    \n    to determine a new king or queen following the death of the previous one (somewhat similar to the\n    Kingsmoot\n    ceremony of the\n    \n     Iron Islands\n    \n    , which Tyrion had also mentioned to Daenerys). This would also remove the possibility of unskilled or inexperienced leaders inheriting the throne. Tyrion claimed that nothing was better at uniting disparate people than a good story, and for that reason he suggested as monarch Brandon Stark, for his story of survival against extreme odds, and his abilities as the\n    \n     Three-Eyed Raven\n    \n    and keeper of the\n    \n     world\n    \n    's memory. Naming him \"Bran the Broken\" - for his inability to walk - Tyrion's idea was swiftly appreciated and accepted by the members of the council.\n   \n\n\n   Despite the support gained for Brandon Stark, his sister Sansa was the only assembled member who did not immediately accept his crown. Saying that the\n   Northmen\n   had suffered too much to ever accept the rule of an outsider again (as could well happen in the future with an elective monarchy), she demanded that the North once again become its own sovereign kingdom, \"as it was for thousands of years.\" This was granted by Brandon, who was thereafter hailed as\n   \n    Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm.\n   \n\n\n\n    Secession of the North\n   \n\n\n   The notion of independence for the Kingdom of the North had been a prevailing issue for many years, ever since\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   beheaded Lord\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   , and Eddard's eldest son\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   was forced to raise his banners in rebellion. Due to his purported\n   illegitimacy\n   , Joffrey's claim to the throne was contested, but the northerners did not wish to support the claims of either\n   \n    Stannis\n   \n   or\n   \n    Renly\n   \n   , the late King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   's brothers. Instead, they crowned Robb King in the North, and declared themselves a free and independent kingdom.\n  \n\n   Robb Stark's war for independence would be successful until he broke his betrothal with\n   \n    Roslin Frey\n   \n   to marry\n   \n    Talisa Maegyr\n   \n   , a\n   \n    Volantene\n   \n   noblewoman whom he had met on the campaign. As a result, Lord\n   \n    Walder Frey\n   \n   (Roslin's father) orchestrated the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   with\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , a successful massacre of the northmen that dined within his halls when Edmure Tully was married to Roslin instead. Both Robb and his mother\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   were killed, intensifying the Stark-Lannister blood feud.\n   Following the Red Wedding,\n   \n    Roose Bolton\n   \n   was named as\n   Lord Paramount of the North\n   and\n   \n    Lord of Winterfell\n   \n   , replacing the Starks and earning the loathing of many northern Houses, whose banners had been pledged to the Stark cause.\n  \n\n   Roose would later be murdered in a conspiracy by his legitimized bastard son,\n   \n    Ramsay Bolton\n   \n   , who would continue to rule the North through fear tactics and brutal violence.

    "question": "What is Game of Thrones about?",
    "response": "Game of Thrones is a fantasy drama series based on George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" novels. It centers on the brutal power struggle for the Iron Throne, the symbolic seat of power in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. The main plot revolves around noble houses, such as the Starks, Lannisters, Targaryens, and Baratheons, engaging in political intrigue, alliances, betrayals, and wars to claim the throne. Key characters include Jon Snow (a bastard-born leader with a mysterious heritage), Daenerys Targaryen (the \"Mother of Dragons\" seeking to reclaim her family's throne), Tyrion Lannister (a clever strategist from a powerful but ruthless house), and others like Cersei Lannister and Arya Stark, who navigate personal vendettas and moral dilemmas.\n\nCentral themes include the corrupting nature of power, family loyalty versus ambition, and the clash between human politics and supernatural threats, such as the White Walkers (an army of the undead) and dragons.

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Dragonstone\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Season 7\n        \n\n         Episode 1\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Airdate\n     \n\n      July 16, 2017\n     \n\n\n\n      Runtime\n     \n\n      59 minutes\n     \n\n\n\n      Written by\n     \n\n\n       David Benioff\n      \n      &\n      \n       D.B.

Lord Frey has summoned every\n   \n    Frey\n   \n   who took part in the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   under the pretext of revealing his plans. Walder orders the servants to serve them wine from the\n   \n    Arbor\n   \n   but harshly tells his latest wife\n   Kitty Frey\n   that he is not wasting any wine on \"a damn woman\". Walder thanks his family for helping him to slaughter the\n   \n    Starks\n   \n   and backhandedly compliments his brood for the violent deaths of\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , his wife\n   \n    Talisa Stark\n   \n   , their unborn child, and Lady\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   , much to the nervous laughter of his family.\n  \n\n   However, when the Freys begin to choke from poisoned wine, Walder chides them for not killing all the Starks. Walder remarks, \"Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe,\" as his family members die around him. \"Walder\" then reveals himself as a disguised\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   , who has exacted vengeance on those who arranged the massacre of her mother and brother at the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   . Arya spares Walder's\n   wife\n   and the servants. She tells them, \"The North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\"\n  \n\n   Later, Arya, having acquired a horse, is riding south when she stumbles upon a group of\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   soldiers who have been sent to the Twins to keep law and order. The soldiers are singing \"Hands of Gold\" and offer to share rabbit meat for dinner. When the soldiers ask why she is riding south, Arya tells them that she is traveling to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Arya learns from the soldiers that the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   and its surroundings have been\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and that the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   has been essentially sealed. The young soldiers insist that she join them around the campfire to eat and rest. When she asks about their adventures, the soldiers admit that they are homesick and once they left home they wished to return to their families. The young soldier offers her blackberry wine while his brother in arms asks why she is traveling south. Arya tells them that she is going to kill\n   \n    the Queen\n   \n   . Thinking that she is joking, they all burst out laughing. Arya smiles and laughs with them.\n  \n\n   Elsewhere,\n   \n    Sandor Clegane\n   \n   is riding north with the\n   \n    Brotherhood Without Banners\n   \n   , through thick snow. They decide to take shelter for the night at an abandoned home but Sandor, recognizing the house, declares it unsafe.\n   \n    Beric Dondarrion\n   \n   dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter the house where they discover the corpses of the\n   Farmer\n   and his daughter\n   Sally\n   , whom he and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.\n  \n\n   Sandor recalls seeing Beric at the tournament at\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , and wonders aloud why Beric keeps getting resurrected, as there's nothing special about him. Beric confides that he does not know what\n   \n    R'hllor\n   \n   , the Lord of Light, is telling him. Sandor remarks that he does not believe in divine justice, citing the fate of the farmer and his daughter. Despite Sandor's fear of flames, Thoros tells him to look into the fire. He tells him that only the fire can show him what the Lord of Light wants him to see. At first, Sandor can only see burning logs, but then, to his own shock, he sees a\n   \n    Wall of Ice\n   \n   . He also sees a\n   \n    castle where the Wall meets the sea\n   \n   , a mountain that looks like an arrowhead, and thousands of the\n   \n    dead\n   \n   marching past. Beric asks Sandor if he now believes that they are here for a reason.\n  \n\n   Later,\n   \n    Thoros\n   \n   finds Sandor burying the dead farmer and his daughter Sally in the snow. Thoros deduces that Sandor knew the dead, but Sandor admits that he doesn't. The two of them bury the bodies together, and Sandor attempts to deliver an epitaph to\n   the Seven\n   , but can't remember the rest of the verse. Instead, he simply tells the dead that they deserve better.\n  \n\n\n    At Winterfell\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , the\n   \n    King in the North\n   \n\n    Jon Snow\n   \n   organizes the defense of the North against the Night King and his army of the dead. He asks that all maesters start searching for\n   \n    dragonglass\n   \n   , stressing it is now more valuable than gold due to its effectiveness against the White Walkers. Jon also requests that Tormund and his people man Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as Tormund and the other wildlings were present at Hardhome and have seen the Night King and Tormund agrees to defend this castle. Jon orders for all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 in his kingdom to be trained in combat in order to defend against the encroaching threat of the White Walkers. Because having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough, he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. When\n   Robett Glover\n   balks at the idea of arming his young granddaughter,\n   \n    Lady\n   \n\n    Lyanna Mormont\n   \n   remarks that she certainly will not remain idle and volunteers to help, giving her assurance that every girl on\n   \n    Bear Island\n   \n   will be trained alongside the boys. The words of the young lady once more remind the older lords of their place and they agree.\n  \n\n   The next order of business is the possibility of the Walkers getting past the wall; if they do, Jon notes that the first obstacles they encounter will be the castles of\n   \n    Last Hearth\n   \n   and\n   Karhold\n   , the seats belonging to the two Northern houses that fought alongside the Boltons. Lord\n   \n    Yohn Royce\n   \n   opines that the castles should be demolished for their lords' treachery, but\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   interjects that Last Hearth and Karhold committed no crimes and urges her half-brother to instead strip the\n   \n    Umbers\n   \n   and\n   \n    Karstarks\n   \n   of their castles as punishment for turning against the Starks. However, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and she reluctantly obliges. Jon then summons\n   Ned Umber\n   and\n   Alys Karstark\n   - both of whom are children who obviously played no part in their father's betrayal and are clearly terrified of what will happen to them. He asks them to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore.\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   watches the proceedings with a smile.\n  \n\n   In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies. He tells Sansa that while she is his sister and she can question his decisions, doing so when he is publicly addressing the Northern lords and ladies undermines his position with them. When Sansa responds that the late\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   did not tolerate dissent, Jon reassures her that h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   is an American fantasy drama television series produced by the\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   cable network.

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out.

He must also win back the allegiance of\n   \n    House Frey\n   \n   , whom he has offended by breaking his marriage pact with them. King Robb has won every battle he has fought, but as with old King\n   \n    Robert\n   \n   , the Starks will have to see if good soldiers make good kings.\n  \n\n   Stannis Baratheon may be defeated and most of his army destroyed or scattered, but he is not out of the fight yet. Having retreated to his headquarters on\n   \n    Dragonstone\n   \n   island with his handful of surviving soldiers, Stannis' status as the last legitimate heir to his older brother Robert still casts a shadow over Joffrey's claim to the throne. With the\n   \n    priestess\n   \n\n    Melisandre\n   \n   at his side, Stannis can still influence the course of the war by striking where least expected.\n  \n\n   The lives of many others still hang in the balance.\n   \n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and his protectors must cross the frozen wastelands of the North to reach the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   , while\n   \n    Arya\n   \n   must brave the war-torn\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   in search of her mother and brother.\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   also has the thankless task of escorting the captive\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   home across hundreds of miles of battlefields and carnage.\n   \n    Theon Greyjoy\n   \n   must face the consequences of his actions at\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   . And in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   both\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   and\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   must brave the currents of a much more dangerous court in order to survive.\n  \n\n   On the\n   \n    eastern continent\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   has fled the political viper-pit of\n   \n    Qarth\n   \n   . Her\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   are growing and her fame is spreading, but to take the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   she will need supporters and an army. Both may be found in the corrupt cities of\n   \n    Slaver's Bay\n   \n   ... for a price.\n  \n\n\n    Beyond the Wall\n   \n   , the\n   \n    White Walkers\n   \n   are on the move, threatening both the Seven Kingdoms and the lands of the\n   \n    Free Folk\n   \n   . While the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   faces the threat of the White Walkers in the field,\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   must infiltrate the wildling army of\n   \n    Mance Rayder\n   \n   and discover the\n   \n    King-Beyond-the-Wall\n   \n   's plans.\n  \n\n\n    Production\n   \n\n\n   The series again filmed primarily in Northern Ireland,\n   and also returned to Iceland and Croatia.\n   The production also added Morocco to the locations roster.\n   The production expanded to three production units, adding a new \"Raven\" unit to the existing \"Dragon\" and \"Wolf\" units.\n  \n\n   Production in Croatia continued to use the walled medieval city of Dubrovnik to film external scenes for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , and Iceland was again used to film scenes set in the frozen lands that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   encounter\n   \n    Beyond the Wall\n   \n   . Production in the new location of Morocco filmed\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   's new storyline in\n   \n    Slaver's Bay\n   \n   as well as some King's Landing exterior shots.\n  \n\n   The scene from the episode \"\n   \n    The Bear and the Maiden Fair\n   \n   \" during which Brienne of Tarth is thrown into a bear pit at\n   \n    Harrenhal\n   \n   involved a real trained stunt bear,\n   Bart the Bear\n   . Due to are various legal restrictions on international transport of large animals such as bears, parts of this scene were\n   \n    technically\n   \n   filmed in Los Angeles in the United States.\n   A duplicate of the bear pit set was created in a Los Angeles studio parking lot: only Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) were brought in to film, with no extras. Both actually did film with the bear in the set.\n  \n\n   Filming in Season 1 included locations in Northern Ireland and Malta, but filming did not return to Malta in subsequent seasons. The Targaryen storyline in\n   \n    Pentos\n   \n   was filmed in the Maltese presidential palace (as well as a few other scenes for King's Landing). Maltese officials were reportedly annoyed that a nude scene was filmed in the palace (Daenerys's bath in the first episode), which may have influenced why production did not return to that country.\n  \n\n   Season 2 expanded to film in Croatia and Iceland, and filming continued in those two countries through Season 3 and Season 4. In Season 3 production expanded to Morocco, but did not return to Morocco for Season 4.\n  \n\n   The result is that the production on Season 3 was a monumental, international effort involving units and cast members which were filming\n   \n    simultaneously\n   \n   in four separate countries. The series has filmed in five countries overall, but filming in Malta ended before production expanded to the other three countries. This number increases to six if one counts the footage of the actor-bear used in Season 3. Because filming did not return to Morocco in Season 4, this makes Season 3 the most widespread international filming project that the TV series has engaged in to date.\n  \n\n\n    Cast\n   \n\n\n\n    Starring cast\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Peter Dinklage\n    \n    as\n    \n     Tyrion Lannister\n    \n\n     (9 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Nikolaj Coster-Waldau\n    \n    as\n    \n     Jaime Lannister\n    \n\n     (7 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Lena Headey\n    \n    as\n    \n     Cersei Lannister\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Emilia Clarke\n    \n    as\n    \n     Daenerys Targaryen\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Kit Harington\n    \n    as\n    \n     Jon Snow\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Richard Madden\n    \n    as\n    \n     Robb Stark\n    \n\n     (7 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Iain Glen\n    \n    as\n    \n     Jorah Mormont\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Michelle Fairley\n    \n    as\n    \n     Catelyn Stark\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Aidan Gillen\n    \n    as\n    \n     Petyr Baelish\n    \n\n     (4 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Charles Dance\n    \n    as\n    \n     Tywin Lannister\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Liam Cunningham\n    \n    as\n    \n     Davos Seaworth\n    \n\n     (4 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Stephen Dillane\n    \n    as\n    \n     Stannis Baratheon\n    \n\n     (5 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Carice van Houten\n    \n    as\n    \n     Melisandre\n    \n\n     (6 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Natalie Dormer\n    \n    as\n    \n     Margaery Tyrell\n    \n\n     (6 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Isaac Hempstead-Wright\n    \n    as\n    \n     Bran Stark\n    \n\n     (6 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Sophie Turner\n    \n    as\n    \n     Sansa Stark\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Maisie Williams\n    \n    as\n    \n     Arya Stark\n    \n\n     (9 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Alfie Allen\n    \n    as\n    \n     Theon Greyjoy\n    \n\n     (6 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     John Bradley\n    \n    as\n    \n     Samwell Tarly\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n    Oona Chaplin\n    as\n    \n     Talisa Stark\n    \n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Game of Thrones\n     \n\n      Season 6\n     \n\n\n\n      Episodes\n     \n\n      10\n     \n\n\n\n      Premiere\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       The Red Woman\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Finale\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       The Winds of Winter\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Transmission dates\n     \n\n      April 24, 2016 to\n      June 26, 2016\n     \n\n\n\n      Production dates\n     \n\n      Late July 2015 to\n      December 17, 2015\n     \n\n\n\n      DVD/Blu-ray\n     \n\n      November 15, 2016\n     \n\n\n     Episode guide\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Previous\n        \n\n         Next\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Season 5\n         \n\n\n\n          Season 7\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The\n   \n    sixth season\n   \n   of\n   \n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   was formally commissioned by HBO on April 8, 2014, following a substantial increase in audience figures between the\n   \n    third\n   \n   and\n   \n    fourth seasons\n   \n   .\n   The\n   \n    fifth\n   \n   and sixth seasons were commissioned simultaneously, the first time\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   has done so for a major drama series.\n  \n\n   The season consists of ten episodes.

Even\n   \n    Grand Maester\n   \n\n    Pycelle\n   \n   has abandoned her, and called her uncle, Ser\n   \n    Kevan Lannister\n   \n   , to rule as the new\n   Hand of the King\n   . Even though Cersei has been released to their custody, her inept leadership nearly destroyed\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   's hold on the throne and they have no intention of ever letting her wield power again. Kevan and Pycelle must attempt to mend the damage Cersei did to the Lannister-\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   alliance. The Lannisters and Tyrells on Kevan's\n   \n    small council\n   \n   maintain a shaky truce as they attempt to deal with the ongoing debt crisis to the\n   \n    Iron Bank of Braavos\n   \n   , as well as the rise of the fanatical\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   due to Cersei's blunders. Cersei meanwhile, though seemingly humbled,\n   \n    still has\n   \n\n    a few schemes\n   \n   she will attempt to play to regain control.\n  \n\n   In the\n   \n    North\n   \n   , the\n   \n    Boltons\n   \n   have\n   \n    triumphed\n   \n   over King\n   \n    Stannis\n   \n   — but in the distraction,\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Theon Greyjoy\n   \n   have escaped, desperately jumping off\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   's castle walls.\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   , who executed Stannis, must now deal with the consequences of putting her vow to avenge King\n   \n    Renly\n   \n   before her oath to protect Sansa.\n  \n\n   In the\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   , after the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   the remaining\n   \n    Tully\n   \n   forces (who were not present at the massacre of their Northern allies) pulled back to\n   \n    Riverrun\n   \n   castle - where they have been hopelessly besieged by\n   \n    House Frey\n   \n   's army ever since.  The garrison is under the command of\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   's great-uncle\n   \n    Brynden \"The Blackfish\" Tully\n   \n   , and is the last bastion of Robb's short-lived independent kingdom that remains unconquered.  Riverrun's garrison may be surrounded and alone, fighting for a dead king, but their defenses are formidable, they have enough food supplies to last for years, and their commander is one of the most experienced and skilled generals in Westeros.  The Lannisters and their Frey allies cannot let the siege of Riverrun continue to drag on if they are ever to claim real control over central Westeros.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   's poisoning of Cersei's daughter, the Princess\n   \n    Myrcella\n   \n   , may now force\n   \n    Doran Martell\n   \n   into the war against the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   he has been fervently trying to avoid.\n  \n\n   Across the\n   \n    Narrow Sea\n   \n   , in the\n   Free City\n   of\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   killed\n   \n    Meryn Trant\n   \n   without the\n   \n    Faceless Men\n   \n   's permission — but without the proper training, the use of one of\n   their masks\n   has poisoned her and rendered her blind. Her training continues, as now the blind little girl must learn to rely on her other senses to survive.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n    Slaver's Bay\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   's attempt to liberate\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   has resulted in massive bloodshed, with the former slave masters\n   \n    conspiring\n   \n   to retake the city. In a large scale ambush on the opening day of the\n   games\n   in\n   Daznak's Pit\n   however, Daenerys climbed onto\n   Drogon\n   's back to try to escape the danger — but she could not make him return to the city. Instead, the young\n   \n    dragon\n   \n   flew north to the southern border of the\n   \n    Dothraki Sea\n   \n   , the lands of his birth, where the stranded Daenerys has been surrounded by a hostile\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n\n\n     khalasar\n    \n\n   numbering in the thousands.\n   \n    Jorah Mormont\n   \n   and\n   \n    Daario Naharis\n   \n   have set out to search for her. Meanwhile, back in the city Daenerys's advisors\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Missandei\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Grey Worm\n   \n   are joined by\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   in attempting to hold together rule over the city wracked by the ongoing insurgency until Daenerys returns — if she returns at all.\n  \n\n   At the Wall,\n   Lord Commander\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   attempted to prepare for the coming of the White Walkers by letting as many\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   through to the south as he could — but tens of thousands more were\n   killed\n   and resurrected as undead\n   \n    wights\n   \n   at\n   \n    Hardhome\n   \n   . The leading\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   officers, increasingly upset at Jon's proposed alliance with the wildlings, have staged a\n   mutiny\n   \n    \"for the Watch\"\n   \n   and stabbed Jon multiple times until he fell.\n  \n\n   Just before the mutiny against Jon Snow, he sent away\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   to go to the\n   Citadel\n   in\n   \n    Oldtown\n   \n   in order to train to be a new\n   \n    maester\n   \n   to replace Maester\n   \n    Aemon\n   \n   after his passing.  Samwell takes\n   \n    Gilly\n   \n   and her young son with him, rather than leave them in the path of the White Walkers.  Oldtown, Westeros's second largest city, is located in the southwest of the\n   \n    Reach\n   \n   , not far away from Sam's former home, the\n   \n    House Tarly\n   \n   castle-seat at\n   Horn Hill\n   .  Samwell and Gilly, however, face a long and difficult sea voyage before they get to the Citadel.\n  \n\n   Distracted by the political intrigues in King's Landing, the exhausted lords of Westeros must now brace for the rise of the\n   kraken\n   — the\n   \n    ironborn\n   \n   led by\n   \n    House Greyjoy\n   \n   . Early in the\n   War of the Five Kings\n   ,\n   \n    Balon Greyjoy\n   \n   declared the\n   \n    Iron Islands\n   \n   ' independence and raided the North while the\n   \n    Stark\n   \n   's army was fighting in the south. Having remained relatively uninvolved ever since, the ironborn's\n   \n    massive fleet\n   \n   remains at full strength, a fact lost on the major powers of the mainland, who have been nearly exhausted fighting each other.\n  \n\n   All of this changes with the sudden return of Balon's exiled younger brother\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   — cunning, ruthless, manipulative, and more than a little insane, he strikes fear even into the other ironborn.  He pushes for the ironborn to launch massive new offensives against the other kingdoms, not simply to raid, but to hold and conquer territory, as Euron's ultimate ambition is nothing less than to conquer all of the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   . He is opposed by Balon's daughter\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   , who urges that the Iron Islands must preserve their strength and engage in diplomacy with the mainland if they are to survive.\n  \n\n   And as the winds of winter begin to sweep through the south, far\n   \n    Beyond the Wall\n   \n   the young\n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Game of Thrones\n     \n\n      Season 1\n     \n\n\n\n      Episodes\n     \n\n      10\n     \n\n\n\n      Premiere\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       Winter Is Coming\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Finale\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       Fire and Blood\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Transmission dates\n     \n\n      April 17, 2011 to\n      June 29, 2011\n     \n\n\n\n      Production dates\n     \n\n      July 23, 2010 to\n      December 18, 2010\n     \n\n\n\n      DVD/Blu-ray\n     \n\n      March 5, 2012\n     \n\n\n     Episode guide\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Next\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Season 2\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The\n   \n    first season\n   \n   of\n   \n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   consists of ten episodes, including a re-shot version of the\n   pilot episode\n   originally filmed in October 2009 and November 2009, and was otherwise filmed between July 23, 2010 and December 18, 2010.

The action begins in the unified\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   as the long summer ends and winter draws near. Lord\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   is asked by his old friend, King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , to serve as the\n   \n    Hand of the King\n   \n   following the death of the previous incumbent, Eddard's mentor\n   \n    Jon Arryn\n   \n   . Eddard is reluctant but receives intelligence suggesting that Jon was murdered. Eddard accepts Robert's offer, planning to use his position and authority to investigate the alleged murder.\n  \n\n   Meanwhile, on the eastern continent of\n   \n    Essos\n   \n   , the exiled children of\n   \n    House Targaryen\n   \n   , which Robert destroyed to claim the throne, are plotting to return to Westeros and unseat the 'usurper'. To this end,\n   \n    Viserys Targaryen\n   \n   arranges the marriage of his sister\n   \n    Daenerys\n   \n   to\n   \n    Khal\n   \n\n    Drogo\n   \n   , the leader of 40,000\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   warriors, in return for the use of his warriors in invading Westeros. For her part, Daenerys just wants to find a safe refuge far away from King Robert's assassins and her brother's scheming ambition.\n  \n\n   Finally, on the northern-most border of the Seven Kingdoms the sworn brothers of the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   guard the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   , a 300-mile-long colossal fortification of ice which has stood for thousands of years. The Watch defends the Wall against the depredations of the lawless\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   who live beyond, but rumor speaks of a\n   \n    new threat\n   \n   arising in the lands of perpetual winter.\n  \n\n\n    Production\n   \n\n\n   Season 1 was mainly filmed on location in\n   Northern Ireland\n   and\n   Malta\n   , with the Paint Hall facility in\n   Belfast\n   being used as the

the performance of many actors (even Sean Bean as Ned Stark), few of them come close to exactly how he pictured them acting in his mind.\n  \n\n\n    Credits\n   \n\n\n\n    Guest starring\n

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December.

In one swift move, she has eliminated nearly all of her enemies, rivals, and obstructions; Queen\n   \n    Margaery Tyrell\n   \n   , Lord\n   \n    Mace Tyrell\n   \n   , Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   , Cersei's uncle Ser\n   \n    Kevan Lannister\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Grand Maester\n   \n\n    Pycelle\n   \n   , the\n   \n    High Sparrow\n   \n   , and most of - if not all - members of the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   were killed when the\n   Great Sept of Baelor\n   was\n   destroyed\n   using large amounts of\n   \n    wildfire\n   \n   , an event orchestrated by Cersei. She has crowned herself the undisputed Queen of the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   , with\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   as her\n   Hand\n   and the undead\n   \n    knight\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   at her side. After nearly four decades of serving as the power behind the throne,\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   has finally become the new royal house. However, Cersei is still haunted by the prophecy she was told during her childhood, which claimed that the deaths of her three (future) children would predate her own;\n   \n    Joffrey\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Myrcella\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   are all dead, Tommen having taken his own life shortly after the Sept's destruction. This has made Cersei all the more determined to crush her enemies once and for all, but the number of her enemies has just increased exponentially. Though she now sits on the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   , she has effectively undone all of\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   's efforts to ensure that his family stay in power as her actions have undoubtedly earned her the hatred of all of Westeros. Most of the realm is either in open rebellion against the Iron Throne or has fallen out of her allies' control, leaving Cersei effectively as the Queen of King's Landing and the lands owned by the Lannisters. It is the beginning of the end.\n  \n\n   In the\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   , the last bastion of\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   's independent\n   Northern-Riverland kingdom\n   ,\n   \n    Riverrun\n   \n   , has fallen to House Lannister and\n   \n    House Frey\n   \n   in a\n   siege\n   led by Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   . Lord\n   \n    Edmure Tully\n   \n   , who had been held hostage by the Freys ever since the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   , ordered the Tully garrison to stand down for the sake of his\n   \n    wife\n   \n   and\n   child\n   , whom Jaime had violently threatened if Edmure refused to cooperate. Edmure's uncle,\n   \n    Brynden \"The Blackfish\" Tully\n   \n   , is dead, having chosen to fight to the death rather than surrender.\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   and her squire,\n   \n    Podrick Payne\n   \n   , had traveled to Riverrun in an attempt to recruit the Blackfish to assist\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   in reclaiming\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   from\n   \n    House Bolton\n   \n   . The attempt failed, and they were only barely able to escape when the castle fell.\n  \n\n   Although House Frey has reclaimed Riverrun, Lord\n   \n    Walder Frey\n   \n   is also dead.\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   , despite nearly being killed by the\n   Waif\n   and ultimately overcoming the assassin in single combat, has completed her training as a\n   \n    Faceless Man\n   \n   in the\n   Free City\n   of\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   . With her original mission clearly back in focus, she has abandoned the Order and returned to Westeros to cross more names off of her list of vengeance, starting with Walder Frey, the last surviving orchestrator of the Red Wedding that claimed the lives of her\n   \n    mother\n   \n   ,\n   \n    brother\n   \n   , and pregnant\n   \n    sister-in-law\n   \n   , at the same time butchering Walder's two most prominent sons,\n   \n    Lothar Frey\n   \n   and\n   \n    Walder Rivers\n   \n   who also helped carry out the massacre, and leaving the rule of the Riverlands in unknown hands. Also,\n   \n    Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane\n   \n   has survived his brutal fight with Brienne of Tarth and attempted to build a new, humble life, but has been dragged back into conflict by the\n   \n    Brotherhood Without Banners\n   \n   , who intend to head north to fight in the war that is coming.\n  \n\n   On the\n   \n    Iron Islands\n   \n   ,\n   King\n   \n    Balon Greyjoy\n   \n   is dead, having been murdered by his psychopathic younger brother,\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   . Balon's son,\n   \n    Theon\n   \n   , returned to the Iron Islands after helping Sansa Stark escape from\n   \n    Ramsay Bolton\n   \n   and endorsed his elder sister,\n   \n    Yara\n   \n   , as their father's successor at the subsequent\n   Kingsmoot\n   . However, Euron has claimed and won the\n   Salt Throne\n   by promising an alliance with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   , which he will use to conquer the Seven Kingdoms. In desperation, and in fear for their lives, Theon and Yara have stolen a hundred ships from the\n   Iron Fleet\n   . With sailors and soldiers loyal to them, they have traveled to\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   and sought out Daenerys's help first. They have managed to secure an alliance between\n   \n    House Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    House Greyjoy\n   \n   to help Daenerys retake the Iron Throne and overthrow Euron in return for the Iron Islands' independence. Euron, however, has ordered the construction of an even bigger fleet to begin his own invasions, seek out new alliances and destroy all who may stand in his way of taking the Seven Kingdoms for himself.\n  \n\n   Also aiding Daenerys are the\n   Dornish\n   and the\n   \n    Tyrells\n   \n   , the\n   rulers\n   of the\n   \n    Reach\n   \n   . In\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Sand Snakes\n   \n   have staged a\n   coup\n   ; they have murdered Prince\n   \n    Doran Martell\n   \n   and his heir,\n   \n    Trystane\n   \n   , and taken control of Dorne in retaliation for Doran's refusal to wage war against House Lannister after the brutal\n   death\n   of his younger brother Prince\n   \n    Oberyn\n   \n   at the hands of Ser Gregor, who also murdered their sister Princess\n   Elia\n   and her two young children, Princess\n   Rhaenys\n   and Prince\n   Aegon\n   . With Cersei declaring war against the Sands for their\n   murder\n   of her daughter Myrcella, Ellaria has turned to Daenerys and her loyalists to help bring down the Lannisters. Unknown to Ellaria, however, is that\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   , Myrcella's uncle, is now serving as Daenerys's\n   Hand of the Queen\n   , and will likely demand justice against the Sands for murdering his beloved niece in cold blood. Lady\n   \n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , herself now a target of Cersei as she is now the only surviving Tyrell, has met with Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, a meeting facilitated by\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   . Although skeptical of their motives (and wary that they essentially\n   murdered their own family\n   to seize power), grief-stricken and incensed by the deaths of her son, grandson, and granddaughter, Olenna pledges House Tyrell's forces to Daenerys in the hope of revenge for her slain family, no longer caring about her own survival.\n  \n\n   In the\n   \n    North\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   and Sansa Stark, aided by Ser\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Tormund Giantsbane\n   \n   , and Lady\n   \n    Lyanna Mormont\n   \n   , have finally defeated Ramsay Bolton and reclaimed Winterfell following a\n   \n    spectacular battle\n   \n   .

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne.

At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   is an American fantasy drama television series produced by the\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   cable network.

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out. Because the third novel was so long, the production team realized it would be imposs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     A Song of Ice and Fire\n    \n\n   is an award-winning series of best-selling books of epic fantasy novels by American author and scriptwriter\n   \n    George R.R.

Another forthcoming Dunk & Egg story which he has fairly well planned out is called\n   \n    The Village Hero\n   \n   and takes place in the Riverlands.\n   Others he intends to write include\n   \n    The Sellsword\n   \n   ,\n   \n    The Champion\n   \n   ,\n   \n    The Kingsguard\n   \n   , and\n   \n    The Lord Commander\n   \n   , along with several as-yet untitled story ideas.\n  \n\n   There are at least nine more, unpublished novellas that Martin tentatively intends to write, for a total of twelve novellas once the entire series is finished.\n  \n\n\n    The Dance of the Dragons prequel novellas\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Princess and the Queen\n    \n    (2013)\n   \n\n\n     The Rogue Prince\n    \n    (2014)\n   \n\n\n   Martin began writing a detailed in-universe history text about the great Targaryen civil war known as the\n   \n    Dance of the Dragons\n   \n   (in which Targaryen fought Targaryen and dragon fought dragon) as a submission for an omnibus of collected works by several authors. In his own words he got a bit carried away, and ended up writing a detailed 80,000 word history even though the maximum length set for the novella submission was 30,000 pages. Martin had to focus only on one 30,000 work piece of the larger story, which he submitted as\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   (2013). This was later followed by\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   (2014), which is about 10,000 words long. Therefore, as of 2015 about half of what he wrote has not been released.\n  \n\n   The narrative conceit that Martin developed for these prequels is a drastic departure from his previous third person POV writing style. Instead, it is presented as an in-universe history text from Westeros written by \"Archmaester Gyldayn\". This format allowed Martin to write about events which were\n   \n    public\n   \n   knowledge to most people in Westeros, while still keeping the secret reasons why people actually did things unknown, or allowing secret betrayals to remain secret. To explain why only a 30,000 page section of the full 80,000 word text Martin wrote was not released, he gave the in-universe explanation that Gyldayn's history text was severely damaged and certain volumes lost, but that new sections are released as soon as the\n   \n    Citadel\n   \n   can locate copies of the missing sections.\n  \n\n   As a result,\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   takes place immediately before\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   , but it isn't really a true \"prequel\" because they were both written at the same time. Rather, it is as if the original draft was divided up into eight parts, of which\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   is \"part two through part four\" and\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   is \"part one\", but the parts were then released out of order. A reader can actually start with\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   , out of publication order, without being spoiled for later events, because this is the order the material was actually originally intended to be read in.\n  \n\n\n    Companion books\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Art of Ice and Fire, Volume I\n    \n    (2005).\n   \n\n\n     The Art of Ice and Fire, Volume II\n    \n    (2011).\n   \n\n\n     A Feast of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2012) - a companion cooking book, with a forward by Martin.\n   \n\n\n     The Lands of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2012) - a collection of map-posters, including exclusive maps previously unreleased with the novels, and the first full map of the known world.\n   \n\n\n     The World of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2014) - a sourcebook containing extensive amounts of previously unreleased information about Westeros, Essos, and other lands. Presented as an in-universe history book, giving a broad overview of the entire world.\n   \n\n\n\n      Fire & Blood\n     \n\n    (2018) - another in-universe history book: while the\n    \n     World\n    \n    book broadly covers everything from the North and the Reach to the Free Cities,\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    is focused in more detail on the three century reign of the Targaryen dynasty up to\n    \n     Aegon III\n    \n    . It is meant to be based on all of Martin's previously unpublished notes about the backstory of House Targaryen. The upcoming prequel series\n    \n\n      House of the Dragon\n     \n\n    is based on this book, specifically the events of the Dance of the Dragons.\n   \n\n\n     Fire & Blood, Volume Two\n    \n    (forthcoming) - a continuation of\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    up to the reign of\n    \n     Aerys II Targaryen\n    \n    , the \"Mad King.\" Martin revealed in July 2017 that\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    would have a second volume due to the size it had grown too, but that he won't continue with it until after the main novels are finished\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The World of Ice & Fire\n    \n\n\n\n\n    The World of Ice & Fire\n   \n   was published in 2014, presented as being an in-universe history book. It presents the expansive backstory of the\n   \n    known world\n   \n   of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   and beyond, much of it never revealed before in the main novels. It has not yet been mentioned within the main novel series, though it is considered to be fully part of the book-continuity canon.\n  \n\n   It was produced as an extensive collaboration between Martin himself and his long-time collaborators/fact-checkers, Elio Garcia and Linda Antonsson, who run the fansite Westeros.org. The project lasted nearly ten years: originally it was intended that Elio & Linda would write most of it as a summation of what was already mentioned in the novels, with Martin writing a few sidebars, but ultimately he produced vast new amounts of material both about the past of Westeros, and about the lands beyond it (actually expanding to detail the histories of lands\n   \n    east\n   \n   of the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   such as\n   \n    Yi Ti\n   \n   , which are barely even mentioned in the main novels).\n  \n\n   Originally the authors found it difficult to simply present an objective compendium/encyclopedia of events, because it would give away major revelations: would an article on\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   actually state that he isn't Ned Stark's son, but\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   's? Would an article about\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   explain why he\n   \n    really\n   \n   killed the Mad King, even though that is a secret revelation only given in the third novel? The answer they came up with was to present it as an in-universe history textbook written by \"Maester Yandel\". Yandel is the author-avatar of Elio & Linda, but at times he quotes from an earlier and more expansive history textbook written by \"Maester Gyldayn\" (the author avatar of George R.R. Martin). Thus the book isn't objective, but represents what is common knowledge to the average and reasonably well-informed lord in Westeros - i.e. most people actually know the general events of the\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   but in the core novels they don't halt the narrative for a dozen pages to give a long speech detailing everything about it. Similarly, most people in real life know the general outline of World War II, but characters in television and movies don't stop to give long speeches outlining the entire event, because they and everyone around them already knows it.\n  \n\n   Martin actually wrote a much longer history of\n   \n    House Targaryen\n   \n   which had to be edited down for the excerpts in\n   \n    The World of Ice & Fire\n   \n   - which were eventually collected into a volume called\n   \n    Fire & Blood\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Spin-offs\n   \n\n\n\n    Board",

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army.

When news of the events reached Sansa Stark in\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , she journeyed south with her brother Bran and her sworn sword,\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   .\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   , who was last seen at\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   with\n   \n    Gilly\n   \n   and\n   her son\n   , also journeyed south. Other lords and ladies had arrived in King's Landing as well to discuss the fate of Jon and Tyrion, and to decide the political future of Westeros.\n  \n\n\n    Election of Bran Stark\n   \n\n\n   When Tyrion Lannister was presented before the council, the Unsullied kept Jon Snow imprisoned, wanting to punish him themselves. Sansa Stark threatened the Unsullied with war if they attempted to harm Jon, to which their leader\n   \n    Grey Worm\n   \n   responded in equal measure.\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   Lady of the Iron Islands\n   and a Daenerys supporter, favored the Unsullied's view, but\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   threatened to kill Yara for even talking about hurting Jon. The situation was defused by\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   , but even he was unable to convince Grey Worm to let Jon go. Tyrion said that only the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms could deliver such justice, to which Grey Worm agreed.\n  \n\n   Daenerys's assassination had left the realm without a clear leader. Although this had essentially been the case for the previous six years - with the\n   War of the Five Kings\n   and the other conflicts that came afterwards - the near-extinction of three Great Houses (\n   \n    Targaryen\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Baratheon\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   ) had created huge uncertainty about who should inherit the throne.\n  \n\n   Members of the Great Council proposed three options for settling the succession:\n  \n\n\n\n     Edmure Tully\n    \n    ,\n    Lord of Riverrun\n    , set himself forward as a candidate for the crown, citing his battle experience as a veteran of two wars, as well as his experience with statecraft as credentials. This suggestion was promptly quashed by his niece, Sansa Stark, who sternly told her uncle to resume his seat.\n   \n\n    Samwell Tarly, who had served in the\n    \n     Night's Watch\n    \n    , suggested that all the people of Westeros select their own monarch, allowing each individual one vote in a democratic system (similar to the\n    Choosing\n    of\n    Lord Commanders\n    in the Watch, and a system that Tyrion had previously mentioned to Daenerys herself). This idea resulted in mocking laughter from the assembled lords, with Edmure and Yohn comparing the idea to giving votes to horses and dogs, and was quickly rejected as well.\n   \n\n    Finally, Tyrion suggested the idea of an\n    elective monarchy\n    , where the lords and ladies of the realm would congregate at the\n    Dragonpit\n    in\n    \n     King's Landing\n    \n    to determine a new king or queen following the death of the previous one (somewhat similar to the\n    Kingsmoot\n    ceremony of the\n    \n     Iron Islands\n    \n    , which Tyrion had also mentioned to Daenerys). This would also remove the possibility of unskilled or inexperienced leaders inheriting the throne. Tyrion claimed that nothing was better at uniting disparate people than a good story, and for that reason he suggested as monarch Brandon Stark, for his story of survival against extreme odds, and his abilities as the\n    \n     Three-Eyed Raven\n    \n    and keeper of the\n    \n     world\n    \n    's memory. Naming him \"Bran the Broken\" - for his inability to walk - Tyrion's idea was swiftly appreciated and accepted by the members of the council.\n   \n\n\n   Despite the support gained for Brandon Stark, his sister Sansa was the only assembled member who did not immediately accept his crown. Saying that the\n   Northmen\n   had suffered too much to ever accept the rule of an outsider again (as could well happen in the future with an elective monarchy), she demanded that the North once again become its own sovereign kingdom, \"as it was for thousands of years.\" This was granted by Brandon, who was thereafter hailed as\n   \n    Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm.\n   \n\n\n\n    Secession of the North\n   \n\n\n   The notion of independence for the Kingdom of the North had been a prevailing issue for many years, ever since\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   beheaded Lord\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   , and Eddard's eldest son\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   was forced to raise his banners in rebellion. Due to his purported\n   illegitimacy\n   , Joffrey's claim to the throne was contested, but the northerners did not wish to support the claims of either\n   \n    Stannis\n   \n   or\n   \n    Renly\n   \n   , the late King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   's brothers. Instead, they crowned Robb King in the North, and declared themselves a free and independent kingdom.\n  \n\n   Robb Stark's war for independence would be successful until he broke his betrothal with\n   \n    Roslin Frey\n   \n   to marry\n   \n    Talisa Maegyr\n   \n   , a\n   \n    Volantene\n   \n   noblewoman whom he had met on the campaign. As a result, Lord\n   \n    Walder Frey\n   \n   (Roslin's father) orchestrated the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   with\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , a successful massacre of the northmen that dined within his halls when Edmure Tully was married to Roslin instead. Both Robb and his mother\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   were killed, intensifying the Stark-Lannister blood feud.\n   Following the Red Wedding,\n   \n    Roose Bolton\n   \n   was named as\n   Lord Paramount of the North\n   and\n   \n    Lord of Winterfell\n   \n   , replacing the Starks and earning the loathing of many northern Houses, whose banners had been pledged to the Stark cause.\n  \n\n   Roose would later be murdered in a conspiracy by his legitimized bastard son,\n   \n    Ramsay Bolton\n   \n   , who would continue to rule the North through fear tactics and brutal violence.

    "question": "What is Game of Thrones about?",
    "response": "Game of Thrones is a fantasy drama series based on George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" novels. It centers on the brutal power struggle for the Iron Throne, the symbolic seat of power in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. The main plot revolves around noble houses, such as the Starks, Lannisters, Targaryens, and Baratheons, engaging in political intrigue, alliances, betrayals, and wars to claim the throne. Key characters include Jon Snow (a bastard-born leader with a mysterious heritage), Daenerys Targaryen (the \"Mother of Dragons\" seeking to reclaim her family's throne), Tyrion Lannister (a clever strategist from a powerful but ruthless house), and others like Cersei Lannister and Arya Stark, who navigate personal vendettas and moral dilemmas.\n\nCentral themes include the corrupting nature of power, family loyalty versus ambition, and the clash between human politics and supernatural threats, such as the White Walkers (an army of the undead) and dragons. The series blends epic battles, complex character arcs, and fantasy elements like magic and mythical creatures, set against a backdrop of medieval-inspired intrigue and moral ambiguity. This sets up ongoing conflicts that explore leadership, survival, and the cost of ambition.",

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army.

Lord Frey has summoned every\n   \n    Frey\n   \n   who took part in the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   under the pretext of revealing his plans. Walder orders the servants to serve them wine from the\n   \n    Arbor\n   \n   but harshly tells his latest wife\n   Kitty Frey\n   that he is not wasting any wine on \"a damn woman\". Walder thanks his family for helping him to slaughter the\n   \n    Starks\n   \n   and backhandedly compliments his brood for the violent deaths of\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , his wife\n   \n    Talisa Stark\n   \n   , their unborn child, and Lady\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   , much to the nervous laughter of his family.\n  \n\n   However, when the Freys begin to choke from poisoned wine, Walder chides them for not killing all the Starks. Walder remarks, \"Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe,\" as his family members die around him. \"Walder\" then reveals himself as a disguised\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   , who has exacted vengeance on those who arranged the massacre of her mother and brother at the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   . Arya spares Walder's\n   wife\n   and the servants. She tells them, \"The North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\"\n  \n\n   Later, Arya, having acquired a horse, is riding south when she stumbles upon a group of\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   soldiers who have been sent to the Twins to keep law and order. The soldiers are singing \"Hands of Gold\" and offer to share rabbit meat for dinner. When the soldiers ask why she is riding south, Arya tells them that she is traveling to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Arya learns from the soldiers that the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   and its surroundings have been\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and that the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   has been essentially sealed. The young soldiers insist that she join them around the campfire to eat and rest. When she asks about their adventures, the soldiers admit that they are homesick and once they left home they wished to return to their families. The young soldier offers her blackberry wine while his brother in arms asks why she is traveling south. Arya tells them that she is going to kill\n   \n    the Queen\n   \n   . Thinking that she is joking, they all burst out laughing. Arya smiles and laughs with them.\n  \n\n   Elsewhere,\n   \n    Sandor Clegane\n   \n   is riding north with the\n   \n    Brotherhood Without Banners\n   \n   , through thick snow. They decide to take shelter for the night at an abandoned home but Sandor, recognizing the house, declares it unsafe.\n   \n    Beric Dondarrion\n   \n   dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter the house where they discover the corpses of the\n   Farmer\n   and his daughter\n   Sally\n   , whom he and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.\n  \n\n   Sandor recalls seeing Beric at the tournament at\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , and wonders aloud why Beric keeps getting resurrected, as there's nothing special about him. Beric confides that he does not know what\n   \n    R'hllor\n   \n   , the Lord of Light, is telling him. Sandor remarks that he does not believe in divine justice, citing the fate of the farmer and his daughter. Despite Sandor's fear of flames, Thoros tells him to look into the fire. He tells him that only the fire can show him what the Lord of Light wants him to see. At first, Sandor can only see burning logs, but then, to his own shock, he sees a\n   \n    Wall of Ice\n   \n   . He also sees a\n   \n    castle where the Wall meets the sea\n   \n   , a mountain that looks like an arrowhead, and thousands of the\n   \n    dead\n   \n   marching past. Beric asks Sandor if he now believes that they are here for a reason.\n  \n\n   Later,\n   \n    Thoros\n   \n   finds Sandor burying the dead farmer and his daughter Sally in the snow. Thoros deduces that Sandor knew the dead, but Sandor admits that he doesn't. The two of them bury the bodies together, and Sandor attempts to deliver an epitaph to\n   the Seven\n   , but can't remember the rest of the verse. Instead, he simply tells the dead that they deserve better.\n  \n\n\n    At Winterfell\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , the\n   \n    King in the North\n   \n\n    Jon Snow\n   \n   organizes the defense of the North against the Night King and his army of the dead. He asks that all maesters start searching for\n   \n    dragonglass\n   \n   , stressing it is now more valuable than gold due to its effectiveness against the White Walkers. Jon also requests that Tormund and his people man Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as Tormund and the other wildlings were present at Hardhome and have seen the Night King and Tormund agrees to defend this castle. Jon orders for all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 in his kingdom to be trained in combat in order to defend against the encroaching threat of the White Walkers. Because having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough, he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. When\n   Robett Glover\n   balks at the idea of arming his young granddaughter,\n   \n    Lady\n   \n\n    Lyanna Mormont\n   \n   remarks that she certainly will not remain idle and volunteers to help, giving her assurance that every girl on\n   \n    Bear Island\n   \n   will be trained alongside the boys. The words of the young lady once more remind the older lords of their place and they agree.\n  \n\n   The next order of business is the possibility of the Walkers getting past the wall; if they do, Jon notes that the first obstacles they encounter will be the castles of\n   \n    Last Hearth\n   \n   and\n   Karhold\n   , the seats belonging to the two Northern houses that fought alongside the Boltons. Lord\n   \n    Yohn Royce\n   \n   opines that the castles should be demolished for their lords' treachery, but\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   interjects that Last Hearth and Karhold committed no crimes and urges her half-brother to instead strip the\n   \n    Umbers\n   \n   and\n   \n    Karstarks\n   \n   of their castles as punishment for turning against the Starks. However, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and she reluctantly obliges. Jon then summons\n   Ned Umber\n   and\n   Alys Karstark\n   - both of whom are children who obviously played no part in their father's betrayal and are clearly terrified of what will happen to them. He asks them to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore.\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   watches the proceedings with a smile.\n  \n\n   In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies. He tells Sansa that while she is his sister and she can question his decisions, doing so when he is publicly addressing the Northern lords and ladies undermines his position with them. When Sansa responds that the late\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   did not tolerate dissent, Jon reassures her that h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   is an American fantasy drama television series produced by the\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   cable network.

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out. Because the third novel was so long, the production team realized it would be imposs",

    "question": "Was Tywin Lanaster a good guy or bad guy?",
    "response": "Tywin Lannister is generally viewed as a \"bad guy\" in Game of Thrones due to his ruthless and often cruel actions, such as leading the brutal sacking of King's Landing, suppressing rebellions with extreme force, and showing favoritism and disdain toward his own children. However, his character is more complex than a simple label—he's driven by a strong sense of duty to his family and house, making decisions that prioritize power and legacy over empathy or ethics. This moral ambiguity invites deeper reflection: what makes someone \"good\" or \"bad\" in a story like this? Consider how themes of family loyalty and power dynamics influence his choices, and think about real-world parallels in history or literature to explore these ideas further.",

Despite the several recent\n   \n    Kings\n   \n   in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , Tywin was the real power in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Tywin was among the richest and most powerful people in\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   . He is a widower with three children,\n   \n    Jaime\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyrion\n   \n   .\n   ​ Casterly Rock, the Lannisters' ancestral seat of power, is located over a group of highly productive goldmines, which have provided the Lannisters with immense wealth and power over the years and led to the joke that Tywin \"shits gold.\"\n  \n\n   Tywin is the beloved son of\n   \n    Tytos Lannister\n   \n   . His father presided over a period of decline for the house, frittering away much of their fortune on poor investments and allowing himself to be mocked at court, creating a perception of weakness. Their vassals\n   House Reyne\n   of\n   Castamere\n   rebelled against Lord Tytos, and Tywin put down the rebellion personally, extinguishing their house and re-establishing the fearsome reputation of House Lannister. His ruthless destruction of House Reyne was immortalized in the song\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   and gave darker meaning to the common phrase \"A Lannister always pays his debts,\" which originally referred solely to the Lannisters' vast fortune.\n  \n\n   Tywin married his cousin\n   Joanna Lannister\n   and their first children were the fraternal twins Cersei and Jaime. She died after giving birth to Tyrion, which Tywin has blamed his son for ever since.\n   When Jaime was diagnosed with a learning difficulty by a\n   \n    maester\n   \n   who predicted that he would never read, Tywin sat with his son for four hours a day until he overcame his problems with transposing letters in his mind, much to Jaime's resentment.\n   Tywin despises his younger son, seeing him as misshapen and perverse. When Tyrion was very young, Jaime set him up with a whore. Jaime posed her as a common girl in distress that they rescued from bandits. Jaime chased the bandits off while Tyrion comforted the girl. They married, but when Tywin found out he was furious and made Jaime reveal the truth. Tywin paid her for every one of his guards to have sex with her and forced Tyrion to watch. Tyrion's hatred of Tywin has been reciprocated since.\n   Nevertheless, all of Tywin's children are in awe of him and heed his counsel.\n   He also took part in the\n   War of the Ninepenny Kings\n   .\n  \n\n   A highly capable administrator, Tywin served as\n   \n    Hand of the King\n   \n   to\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   for twenty years until the Mad King, driven by envy and distrust, rejected Tywin's proposal to marry his daughter Cersei to Prince\n   \n    Rhaegar\n   \n   and made his son Jaime a member of the Kingsguard. As members of the Kingsguard are forbidden to marry, Aerys had effectively robbed Tywin of his heir, which Tywin perceived as a great insult and resigned.\n   During\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   Tywin remained neutral, answering neither the summons of the King nor the calls from the rebels, until the\n   \n    Battle of the Trident\n   \n   , after which it became clear that the rebels would win. Tywin marched with the full power of Casterly Rock to the capital, feigning that he had come to defend it from the rebellion. Aerys' advisors urged the King not to trust Tywin, even Jaime Lannister, who knew his father would never back the losing side in a war.\n  \n\n   Nevertheless, on Pycelle's advice, the gates were opened to the massive Lannister army of 10 000 soldiers and began killing hundreds, even thousands of people. Tywin and his army ordered the city to be taken and the royal family murdered in a ruthless and efficient manner; as a result the city was\n   \n    sacked\n   \n   and the royal family massacred by Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   . Upon seeing Tywin's betrayal, Aerys ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin's head and instructed his royal\n   pyromancer\n   to\n   set King's Landing ablaze\n   . Jaime responded by personally stabbing the Mad King in the back, then slitting his throat. When Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark reached the Red Keep, Tywin presented the bodies of the royal family as proof of his allegiance. After the rebellion,\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   took the throne and married Tywin's daughter Cersei to cement the alliance between their houses.\n  \n\n   Cersei gave birth to three children:\n   \n    Joffrey\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Myrcella\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   . Unbeknownst to Tywin, all three children are the product of her incestuous\n   relationship\n   with Jaime.\n   This was d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     The Children\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Season 4\n        \n\n         Episode 10\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Airdate\n     \n\n      June 15, 2014\n     \n\n\n\n      Runtime\n     \n\n      66 minutes\n     \n\n\n\n      Written by\n     \n\n\n       David Benioff\n      \n      &\n      \n       D.B.

Jon eventually reaches the\n   tree line\n   and is quickly surrounded by\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   , who bring him before Mance. Mance notes that he is wearing the black of the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   again. He brings Jon inside his tent, and questions his status as a traitor. Jon confesses that his time spent with the wildlings was all part of a plan orchestrated by\n   \n    Qhorin\n   \n   to get Jon to infiltrate Mance's army, and that Qhorin tricked Mance into trusting Jon by allowing Jon to kill Qhorin himself in a fight. Mance asks about\n   \n    Ygritte\n   \n   . Saddened, Jon reveals that she died at the\n   \n    Battle of Castle Black\n   \n   , though not by his hands. Mance somberly proposes that they drink a toast to her memory, and Jon agrees, but is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink. Jon accepts after Mance assures him that if he'd wanted to kill Jon, poison would be the last of his methods. They drink to Ygritte. Mance then asks about the\n   \n    giant\n   \n   who got through the gate but never came out, and Jon informs Mance that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend\n   \n    Grenn\n   \n   . Mance ruefully notes that the giant was named\n   Mag the Mighty\n   , and he was \"king\" of the giants, the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the\n   \n    First Men\n   \n   entered\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   , to which Jon then glibly notes that his friend Grenn was from a farm. They have another toast to Mag and Grenn.\n  \n\n   Jon then proposes his terms to Mance: turn his army around and return home. Mance immediately counters that the Night's Watch is low on oil, arrows, and men, and when he sent his full force against the Wall the Night's Watch threw everything they had at him to repel the attack. Mance guesses there are no more than 50 men left guarding\n   \n    Castle Black\n   \n   , but Jon lies and insists that there are still over 1,000 men defending the garrison. However, Mance calls Jon's bluff and reveals that after seeing how few men were defending Castle Black, he sent 400 men about five miles west to climb an unmanned section of the Wall, and they will attack Castle Black's weak southern side as soon as he gives the order. Mance then changes his demeanor and reveals that his people have suffered enough bloodshed and that he has no intention of conquering the lands south of the Wall; that the wildlings are moving south to seek refuge from the growing threat of the\n   \n    White Walkers\n   \n   just as those south of the Wall are. Mance then makes his counteroffer: if the Night's Watch will open the gates to the wildlings and allow them to pass through the Wall, no more harm will come to the black brothers. However, if his terms are refused, his wildling army will slaughter every last member of the Night's Watch and move south by force.\n  \n\n   Mance then notices that Jon is eyeing a cooking knife, and quickly deduces that Jon came to\n   parley\n   with Mance simply so he could assassinate him. He notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that Jon might actually be able to kill him before being cut down himself, but that Jon must have\n   \n    known\n   \n   he would die assassinating Mance. Mance is shocked and questions Jon if this is what the Night's Watch has sunk to: killing a man who let him into his own tent, who offered him (relatively) reasonable peace terms. Jon hesitates, but before anyone can make a move, war horns are heard from outside. Mance's guards safely grab Jon during the distraction, and Mance demands to know if the Night's Watch is attacking them, but Jon admits that it's just as Mance said: the Night's Watch doesn't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the Wall and attack.\n  \n\n   Columns of heavy horse carrying hundreds of mounted cavalry charge into the wildling camp carrying the flaming stag banners of\n   \n    House Baratheon of Dragonstone\n   \n   , and are led by none other than\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   and\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   . The wildlings are caught in their own camp, resting from the battle the night before and only expecting attacks from the Wall, so their eastern flank is completely undefended. As they are undisciplined and have no experience fighting heavily armored cavalry, they are quickly dispatched by Stannis' riders, who attack the wildling camp from both sides in two separate columns that catch the wildlings in a perfect double envelopment. Quickly cutting the wildling forces down, Stannis and Davos ride up to Mance, who throws down his weapons in surrender, officially ending the wildlings' siege of Castle Black.\n  \n\n   Davos introduces Stannis as the true king of the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   , but Mance wryly points out that they are not currently\n   \n    in\n   \n   the Seven Kingdoms. Stannis demands that it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king. Resignedly, Mance says that the Free Folk do not kneel, knowing that Stannis will kill him if he does not. Davos, however, asks what a man of the Night's Watch is doing in the camp, and Jon explains that he came to treaty with the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Jon says that he knows that Stannis is the true king, as his own father died supporting his claim, revealing himself as the bastard son of\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   . This makes Stannis regard Jon more seriously. Stannis proclaims that Eddard was an honorable man, and asks Jon what Ned would have done with Mance. Jon responds that Mance could have killed him or tortured him when he was his captive but instead he spared his life. Jon tells Stannis that his father would have taken Mance prisoner and listened to what he had to say. Before they leave the wildling camp, Jon also urges Stannis to burn the dead before nightfall.\n  \n\n   Back at Castle Black, a funeral is held for the slain members of the Night's Watch, who have been arranged in a huge funeral pyre in the castle courtyard. Maester\n   \n    Aemon\n   \n   delivers a eulogy, saying that they died to protect the men, women, and children of the south who will never even know who they were, that it is the duty of the surviving black brothers to keep alive their memory. Aemon closes his speech with the customary line, \"and now their watch has ended,\" which is repeated by the gathered men.\n   \n    Samwell\n   \n   then aids Aemon in setting the pyre alight, which is continued by Jon and other men carrying torches. Stannis and Davos look on, along with Queen\n   \n    Selyse\n   \n   and Princess\n   \n    Shireen\n   \n   . Jon looks across the flames and catches the gaze of\n   \n    Melisandre\n   \n   , who is standing on the opposite side of the pyre. Melisandre seems intrigued, her piercing stare clearly making Jon uneasy.\n  \n\n   Afterwards, Jon enters the chamber of the castle where\n   \n    Tormund\n   \n   is being held. Tormund asks why blind old Maester Aemon patched up his arrow wounds, and Jon says that Aemon is sworn to heal all wounded men, friend or foe. Tormund asks if Jon really loved Ygritte, telling Jon that Ygritte truly loved him. Jon asks if Ygritte told Tormund this but Tormund says no, he knew Ygritte loved him because all she ever talked about was killing him. Saddened, Tormund implores Jon that Ygritte's final resting place should be in \"the\n   \n    real\n   \n   north.\" Jon then takes Ygritte's corpse to the north side of the Wall and builds a funeral pyre for her near a sacred\n   Heart tree\n   . Jon looks at his lover one last time and lights her pyre, and weeps silently as he turns his back and heads home.\n  \n\n\n    Beyond th \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Tytos Lannister\n    \n\n\n      Season(s)\n     \n\n      1\n      ,\n      2\n     \n\n\n\n      Mentioned in\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       The Pointy End\n      \n      \"\n      \"\n      House Lannister\n      \"\n      \"\n      \n       The Old Gods and the New\n      \n      \"\n      \"\n      House Clegane\n      \"\n      \"\n      The Westerlands\n      \"\n      \"\n      The Rains of Castamere\n      \"\n      \"\n      \n       The Iron Throne\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Titles\n     \n\n      Lord of Casterly Rock\n      Lord Paramount of the Westerlands\n      Warden of the West\n     \n\n\n\n      Also known as\n     \n\n      The Toothless Lion\n      The Laughing Lion\n     \n\n\n\n      Status\n     \n\n\n\n      Origin\n     \n\n\n       Casterly Rock\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Allegiance\n     \n\n\n       House Lannister\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Successor\n     \n\n      {\n      \n       Tywin Lannister\n      \n      }\n     \n\n\n\n      Culture\n     \n\n      Andal\n     \n\n\n\n      Spouse\n     \n\n      {\n      Jeyne Marbrand\n      }\n     \n\n\n\n      Children\n     \n\n      {\n      \n       Tywin Lannister\n      \n      }\n      {\n      \n       Kevan Lannister\n      \n      }\n      {\n      Gerion Lannister\n      }\n      Genna Lannister\n      {\n      Tygett Lannister\n      }\n     \n\n\n\n      Siblings\n     \n\n      {\n      Tywald Lannister\n      }\n      {\n      Tion Lannister\n      }\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Lord\n   \n    Tytos Lannister\n   \n   was the\n   Lord of Casterly Rock\n   and head of\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   .

The Lannisters are the richest and one of the most influential families in Westeros. He was the father of five children,\n   , including\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   and\n   \n    Kevan Lannister\n   \n   , and grandfather of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Jaime\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Tyrion\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Lancel\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Lord Tytos raised the\n   kennelmaster of Casterly Rock\n   to\n   \n    knighthood\n   \n   after the latter saved him from a\n   lioness\n   that tried to kill him. He also granted him lands, a\n   keep\n   , and the kennelmaster's son was taken as a squire. Thus\n   House Clegane\n   was born.\n  \n\n   Tytos presided over a period of decline for the House. He frittered away much of their fortune on poor investments and allowed himself to be mocked at court creating a perception of weakness.\n  \n\n   This reputation led the Lannister vassals of\n   House Reyne\n   of\n   Castamere\n   to eventually rise in\n   rebellion\n   . Tytos's successor, Tywin, put down the rebellion personally, extinguishing their house and re-establishing the fearsome reputation of House Lannister. His ruthlessness gave darker meaning to the common phrase \"A Lannister always pays his debts\" and was immortalized in the song\n   \n    The Rains of Castamere\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   When arriving at his father's encampment with a number of\n   hill tribe\n   leaders,\n   \n    Tyrion\n   \n   introduces his father to them, calling him \"Tywin, son of Tytos\".\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   At\n   \n    Harrenhal\n   \n   , Tywin recalls watching Tytos growing old to\n   \n    his cupbearer\n   \n   .

He loaned money to lords who never bothered to repay him and his vassals openly ignored his orders, mocking him in open court. This made his son Tywin mistrust laughter, and become a hard and cold man.\n  \n\n   Tytos's father was Gerold the Golden, who appears in the\n   \n    Tales of Dunk and Egg\n   \n   prequel novellas set 90 years before the events of the main series. His mother was Rohanne Webber, the Lady of Coldmoat and a prominent character in the novella\n   \n    The Sworn Sword\n   \n   . Gerold and Rohanne had at least four sons together: the twins Tywald and Tion, then Tytos, then Jason. As a third son, Tytos was not initially expected to rule, but both of his older brothers died without issue while their father was still alive, meaning that Tytos directly succeeded Gerold. Tywald died in the same battle against an outlaw lord in which King\n   Maekar Targaryen\n   died. He had been betrothed to Ellyn Reyne, so to maintain the alliance she was married to Tion. For a time Ellyn dominated Casterly Rock, but their marriage proved childless, and Tion later died in the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion. After Ellyn's failed attempt to seduce Tytos was reported to him by Tytos's wife Jeyne, Gerold rid the castle of Ellyn by marrying her off to old lord Walderan Tarbeck - but she then proceeded to have numerous children by him. Tytos himself had married Jeyne Marbrand, and there came to be a bitter rivalry between the two women due to Ellyn's attempt to seduce her husband. Ellyn Tarbeck named her children after dead Lannister relatives, to spite them. Tytos and Jeyne had four sons: Tywin, Kevan,\n   Tygett\n   , and\n   Gerion\n   , as well as one daughter,\n   Genna\n   . Jeyne died only one month after giving birth to Gerion. Jason, meanwhile, was married off to Marla Prester, by whom he had five children, including\n   Stafford\n   and\n   Joanna\n   . Tywin would later marry Joanna, his own first cousin, and she bore him Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion.\n  \n\n   Tytos's daughter Genna states that growing up as a younger son made Tytos eager to please those around him, particularly men who were older than him. Tytos was even eager for the acceptance of older men who were his own vassals, or minor vassals of other Houses. Tytos agreed to marry Genna to\n   \n    Walder Frey\n   \n   's son Emmon, who was his second son and thus not even his heir, simply to please Lord Frey. Despite being only ten years old, Tywin was the only one who spoke out against this, pointing out how drastically uneven the match was. Even if Walder had offered his eldest son and heir in marriage, it would still have been marrying beneath Genna's station, as the Freys were only vassals of House Tully, not another Great House like the Lannisters. Years later when Tywin came to rule House Lannister, he became insulted at the prospect of Cersei settling for anything less than a royal marriage.\n  \n\n   According to\n   \n    Kevan\n   \n   , Lord Tytos allowed his mistress - a woman scarcely one step above a whore - to move into their castle after his wife's death, act as if she was mistress of the Rock, demanded and wore his late wife's jewels, and even spoke for Tytos when he was sick. She grew so influential that it was said in\n   Lannisport\n   that any man who wished for his petition to be heard should kneel before her, for Tytos's ears were between her legs. After Tytos died of a heart attack while climbing upstairs to see her, Tywin sent her naked and penniless out the front gate. For further humiliation, she was forced to walk naked through the streets of Lannisport for two weeks, and to confess to every man she met that she was a thief and a whore. Although no man laid a hand on her during this humiliation (as Tywin had threatened to punish any who physically harmed her), that was the end of her power.\n  \n\n   Cersei thinks about her grandfather's mistress, while she performs the same humiliating punishment. Though she had been too young to witness the spectacle herself, she had heard the stories from those who had been there: they spoke of how the woman had wept and begged, of the desperate way she clung to her garments when she was commanded to disrobe, of her futile efforts to cover her breasts and her sex with her hands as she hobbled barefoot and naked through the streets to exile. “Vain and proud she was, before,” Cersei remembered one guard",

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     The Iron Throne\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Season 8\n        \n\n         Episode 6\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Airdate\n     \n\n      May 19, 2019\n     \n\n\n\n      Runtime\n     \n\n      79 minutes\n     \n\n\n\n      Written by\n     \n\n\n       David Benioff\n      \n      &\n      \n       D.B.

Tyrion leaves them and walks alone towards the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   . Once inside, he heads towards the cellar and takes the same escape route\n   \n    Jaime\n   \n   had taken him through on the eve of his scheduled beheading courtesy of their father's sentencing, when Tyrion was falsely accused of\n   \n    killing Joffrey\n   \n   . Tyrion walks through the rubble and remains of the Red Keep, searching for his siblings. He spots Jaime's golden hand under the rubble. Devastated by this sign, Tyrion clears away the rubble stone by stone to find the corpse of his sister, and is visibly shaken by it. Knowing his brother is next to her under the debris, Tyrion painfully continues to clear away broken rock and begins to cry when he finds Jaime. His dead brother's death-wish has been fulfilled: Jaime \"died in the arms of the woman he loved.\"\n  \n\n   Meanwhile, Jon finds\n   \n    Grey Worm\n   \n   about to execute the remainder of the Lannister forces and tries to stop him, telling him it's over. Grey Worm says it won't be over until Daenerys's enemies are defeated, but Davos asks him, \"How much more defeated do you need them to be? They're on their knees!\" Grey Worm tells Davos he only obeys the queen's commands; Jon asks Grey Worm what are those commands. Grey Worm replies he has orders to kill all who follow Cersei Lannister and that these men chose to fight for her. Grey Worm takes out his knife to execute the men, and Jon tries to stop him. Immediately, all of Daenerys's soldiers take aim at Jon, while the Northerners accompanying Jon draw their swords. Davos diffuses the confrontation, telling Jon they should speak with Daenerys. As Jon and Davos leave, Grey Worm starts to slit the prisoners' throats one by one.\n  \n\n   Outside the gates of the city, the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   are celebrating their victory. A stony-faced\n   \n    Arya\n   \n   appears from the ruined city covered in ash, blood, and grime. Jon pushes his way through the crowd of Dothraki and goes toward the gate, upon which a huge\n   \n    Targaryen\n   \n   banner is hanging. As Jon reaches the top, Grey Worm also appears and they exchange a tense look.\n   \n    Drogon\n   \n   appears with\n   \n    Daenerys\n   \n   and lands behind them. She walks out to address her army, amidst much cheering from them. \"You tore down their stone houses, you gave me the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   ,\" she tells the Dothraki. Daenerys promotes Grey Worm as the Commander of all her forces and the\n   Master of War\n   . She also praises the\n   \n    Unsullied\n   \n   and calls her forces 'liberators' for 'freeing' the people of\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Jon watches this, concerned. Tyrion comes to the scene, looking devastated by his brother's death. Daenerys now wants to break the wheel and enlists her army to aid her in 'liberating' not only all of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   , but the world: \"From\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   to\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   , from\n   Lannisport\n   to\n   \n    Qarth\n   \n   , from the\n   \n    Summer Islands\n   \n   to the\n   Jade Sea\n   ,\" destroying the tyrants of the world. From behind the cheering armies, Arya looks up balefully at Daenerys. When Daenerys sees Tyrion, she accuses him of treason since he freed Jaime. He replies, \"I freed my brother, and you slaughtered a city,\" with a look of disgust, throwing away his \"Hand of the Queen\" brooch. Outraged by this show of defiance, Daenerys tells her men to take him away. Perturbed, Jon and Tyrion make eye contact before Jon turns to face Daenerys. They share a tense silence before she leaves.\n  \n\n   Arya silently appears beside Jon while he watches Daenerys leave. Jon is surprised that his sister is in King's Landing; when he notices her bloody face, he asks what happened to her. Arya tells him that she came to kill Cersei, but Daenerys got to her first. She says that\n   \n    Sansa\n   \n   won't bend the knee to Daenerys. Jon responds that Daenerys is the queen now, and asks Arya to wait for him outside the city gates. Arya warns Jon that Daenerys knows who he really is and will view him as a threat due to his claim on the Iron Throne. Before she leaves, Arya tells Jon in reference to Daenerys, \"I know a killer when I see one.\"\n  \n\n   Jon visits Tyrion in prison. After asking Jon if he brought wine, Tyrion says that their queen doesn't keep prisoners for long, \"I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   's ashes can tell my ashes, 'See? I told you so.'\" He knows his death is certain and asks Jon if there is life after death. Jon tells him, \"Not that I've seen.\" Grimly noting that oblivion is the best he could hope for, Tyrion goes over his past sins, including\n   murdering his lover and father\n   and betraying their queen. When Jon tries to tell Tyrion he didn't, Tyrion says he did... and he'd do it again, now he's seen what Daenerys is truly capable of, telling Jon, \"I chose my fate, the people of King's Landing did not.\" Jon is disturbed by what Daenerys did and is unable to justify it, but believes the war is over now. Tyrion questions Jon, \"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?\" He goes on to say, \"She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She 'liberated' the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all\". Jon angrily responds that Tyrion has been counseling her, and Tyrion agrees, \"Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.\" Jon is upset by the notion that blood defines who they are, saying Daenerys is not\n   \n    her father\n   \n   as Tyrion is not\n   \n    his father\n   \n   . Tyrion admits that Tywin and Cersei were both evil, but reminds Jon that Daenerys has killed more people than Tywin, Cersei and any of the evil people they know. Jon tries to defend Daenerys, going over her various traumas (\n   \n    Missandei\n   \n   's murder,\n   \n    Rhaegal\n   \n   's death) and Cersei's actions, but Tyrion reminds Jon, \"And she burned down a city for it.\" He forces Jon to pause when he asks, \"Would you have done it?\"; he tries to make Jon see that, if he had been in the same place, knowing what it's like to be on dragonback with that power, Jon wouldn't have done the same thing. Tyrion realizes Jon doesn't want to betray Daenerys. He goes over Daenerys's history of killing evil men, and how everyone supported her for it, but she grew more and more powerful, more convinced of her rightness. Tyrion says that Daenerys is convinced it is her destiny to make the world better for everyone and will do whatever it takes to build the ideal world she wants, no matter how many must die to make it reality.\n  \n\n   Tyrion reasons with a tortured Jon, \"I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason.\" Recalling\n   \n    Maester Aemon\n   \n   's words, Jon reflects, \"Love is the death of duty.\" Tyrion agrees and says that sometimes, duty must be the death of love, \"You are the shield that guards the realms of men. You've already tried to do the right thing, no matter the cost. You've tried to protect the people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?\" Tyrion acknowledges assassinating Daenerys is a terrible thing he's asking Jon to do, but says it's also the right thing.

He wakes up to find his\n   \n    direwolf\n   \n\n    Summer\n   \n   by his side.\n   \n    Theon Greyjoy\n   \n   summons\n   \n    Hodor\n   \n   , the castle's dim-witted stableboy, who can only say the word \"Hodor\", to help carry Bran down to the great hall, where\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   is hosting a meeting with\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   and\n   \n    Yoren\n   \n   , both traveling down from the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   together. Robb very pointedly offers hospitality to any man of the Watch, silently letting Tyrion know he is not invited to stay at Winterfell.\n  \n\n   When Bran arrives, Tyrion asks if he likes to ride and sympathizes with him for being a cripple, which annoys Bran, but Tyrion simply says that like being a dwarf, it is the truth, no less so for being a hard truth. He gives Bran the design of a saddle which will allow Bran to ride even in his current state; Tyrion explains to Robb that \"you must shape the horse to the rider,\" by starting with a yearling and training it to respond to the reins and Bran's voice (as he can't use his heels). He does it to repay Bran's\n   \n    half-brother\n   \n   's friendship and because he has a weakness for \"cripples, bastards and broken things.\" Due to this kindness, Robb says he can stay, but Tyrion says he would prefer the brothel in town. As he prepares to leave the castle, Theon comes to Tyrion and rather condescendingly sends him off, recommending the prostitute\n   \n    Ros\n   \n   at the brothel. Tyrion asks Theon why Lady\n   \n    Catelyn\n   \n   was not present to receive him and concludes that Catelyn is not in Winterfell. He also taunts Theon about how the son of the ferocious\n   \n    Balon Greyjoy\n   \n   has been reduced to playing lackey in Winterfell to his captors, which infuriates Theon, and gives him a coin, assuming that he has not already had sex with Ros.\n  \n\n\n    At the Wall\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Castle Black\n   \n   , a new recruit for the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   has arrived:\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   , the son of the famous Lord\n   \n    Randyll Tarly\n   \n   . Samwell is fat, soft and pampered, and in his first practice fight does dismally. Ser\n   \n    Alliser Thorne\n   \n   has no time for his weakness. He directs the other recruits to attack 'Ser Piggy', but Jon Snow finds this cruel and unfair, and takes pity on Sam and fends off the attackers. Thorne tries to turn it into a game, ordering three trainees take on Sam's protector (taunting Jon that he has found a new Lady love), but Jon nevertheless fends them all off. Samwell is naive and self-deprecating, claiming to be a coward and craven, to Jon's astonishment. No one admits to being a coward, and\n   \n    Grenn\n   \n   says that they shouldn't even be seen talking to him.\n  \n\n   Sam joins Jon on the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   for sentry duty, even though he says his eyesight is weak, he is afraid of heights, and can't take the cold. Jon asks why he joined the Night's Watch as he is afraid of everything. Sam tells him that on his eighteenth\n   nameday\n   his father offered him a choice. Sam was a man and his heir, but he was not skilled at combat, he was unworthy of his name and birthright. Samwell's father forced him to join the Night's Watch, and told him that if he refused, he would arrange a \"hunting trip\" with his son in the woods, and implied that Sam would be killed in a way that looked accidental. Jon is shocked that a true born son of high birth should be treated worse than he himself had been as a\n   \n    bastard\n   \n   . Sam knows that the next day he will be made to fight again and expects it to be bad.\n  \n\n   At the Wall, Jon orders the recruits to go easy on Sam, but\n   \n    Rast\n   \n   refuses, saying that if Ser Alliser orders him to fight 'Lady Piggy', he will slice himself off a side of bacon. In response to Rast's comments, Jon goes to his bed that night and uses his direwolf\n   \n    Ghost\n   \n   to intimidate Rast into playing along. The next day, no one will fight Sam. After Grenn takes a very weak blow from Sam and yields, Ser Alliser scolds Jon for his rebellious actions. Later, when Jon and Sam are cleaning the dining hall, they talk about how neither of them have been with a woman. Sam tells Jon that he has not had success with girls, while Jon reveals he'd rather not risk siring a child that will have the life of a\n   \n    bastard\n   \n   like himself. A furious Alliser Thorne comes in and tells Jon that this charity won't help Sam harden up to survive the winter that is coming. He tells them the truly horrific experience he went through trapped by a blizzard north of the Wall that ended in\n   cannibalism\n   .\n  \n\n\n    In Vaes Dothrak\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Khal\n    \n\n\n    Drogo\n   \n   's\n   \n\n     khalasar\n    \n\n   arrives at\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   , the Dothraki city. There are no city walls, but there is a large gateway arch made of two statues of rearing horses.\n   \n    Viserys\n   \n   is annoyed that Drogo has been taking 'his' army in the wrong direction. Later, he bathes with\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   and tells her about how he was raised with stories about the\n   \n    Targaryen\n   \n\n    dragons\n   \n   and his own destiny. He recites the names of several dragons, and tells her about the skulls of dragons that once decorated the throne room at King's Landing, but she starts to annoy him with talk of dragons, reminding him that they are dead. He tells her to finish pleasuring him in silence.\n  \n\n   Viserys is enraged when\n   \n    Daenerys\n   \n   sends Doreah with an invite for him to dine with her, as he interprets this as his sister\n   \n    commanding\n   \n   him to come. He drags Doreah into Daenerys' tent, and insults her dinner and the gifts of clothes she tries to give him. He is still dressed in his now ragged clothes from\n   \n    Pentos\n   \n   , having refused to dress like a Dothraki, whom he regards as savages. He sneers that next she will try to braid his hair like a Dothraki. Angered by his ingratitude, Daenerys retorts that he has no right to braid his hair until he is victorious in battle, which further infuriates him. In his anger, Viserys tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her, calling her nothing but a \"horselord's slut\", and warning her that she's \"awoken the Dragon\", but this time she fights back, hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt. She tells a stunned Viserys, who can only gawp at her in astonishment, that she is the Khal's wife, and is carrying his child (and by implication, Viserys is nothing to the Dothraki), and warns that if he raises a hand against her again, he will lose his hands. Later, Daenerys confides in\n   \n    Mormont\n   \n   her realization that Viserys will never become\n   \n    King of Westeros\n   \n   . He is so weak and ineffectual that he couldn't command an army even if Drogo gave him one, to which Jorah agrees.\n  \n\n\n    In King's Landing\n   \n\n\n   In the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   visits the\n   \n    Great Hall\n   \n   , where the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   sits.

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   .

Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne.

He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Conleth Hill\n    \n\n\n      Date of birth\n     \n\n      November 24,1964\n     \n\n\n\n      Birthplace\n     \n\n      Ballycastle, Northern Ireland\n     \n\n\n\n      Role\n     \n\n\n       Varys\n      \n\n\n\n\n      First episode\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       Lord Snow\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Last episode\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       The Bells\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n\n       External links\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Conleth Seamus Eoin Croiston Hill\n   \n   (born 24 November 1964) is a Northern Irish film, stage and television actor.

He was confirmed in the role on 15 July 2010. He initially appeared as a guest star in the\n   \n    first season\n   \n   and joined the starring cast for the\n   \n    second season\n   \n   .

the performance of many actors (even Sean Bean as Ned Stark), few of them come close to exactly how he pictured them acting in his mind.\n  \n\n\n    Credits\n   \n\n\n\n    Guest starring\n

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out. Because the third novel was so long, the production team realized it would be imposs",

The most prominent include Jon Snow, a leader in the North; Daenerys Targaryen, a powerful claimant to the throne; and Tyrion Lannister, a strategic advisor. These characters, along with others like Arya Stark and Cersei Lannister, help explore the series' themes of power, loyalty, and survival.

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out.

Lord Frey has summoned every\n   \n    Frey\n   \n   who took part in the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   under the pretext of revealing his plans. Walder orders the servants to serve them wine from the\n   \n    Arbor\n   \n   but harshly tells his latest wife\n   Kitty Frey\n   that he is not wasting any wine on \"a damn woman\". Walder thanks his family for helping him to slaughter the\n   \n    Starks\n   \n   and backhandedly compliments his brood for the violent deaths of\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , his wife\n   \n    Talisa Stark\n   \n   , their unborn child, and Lady\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   , much to the nervous laughter of his family.\n  \n\n   However, when the Freys begin to choke from poisoned wine, Walder chides them for not killing all the Starks. Walder remarks, \"Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe,\" as his family members die around him. \"Walder\" then reveals himself as a disguised\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   , who has exacted vengeance on those who arranged the massacre of her mother and brother at the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   . Arya spares Walder's\n   wife\n   and the servants. She tells them, \"The North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\"\n  \n\n   Later, Arya, having acquired a horse, is riding south when she stumbles upon a group of\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   soldiers who have been sent to the Twins to keep law and order. The soldiers are singing \"Hands of Gold\" and offer to share rabbit meat for dinner. When the soldiers ask why she is riding south, Arya tells them that she is traveling to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Arya learns from the soldiers that the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   and its surroundings have been\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and that the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   has been essentially sealed. The young soldiers insist that she join them around the campfire to eat and rest. When she asks about their adventures, the soldiers admit that they are homesick and once they left home they wished to return to their families. The young soldier offers her blackberry wine while his brother in arms asks why she is traveling south. Arya tells them that she is going to kill\n   \n    the Queen\n   \n   . Thinking that she is joking, they all burst out laughing. Arya smiles and laughs with them.\n  \n\n   Elsewhere,\n   \n    Sandor Clegane\n   \n   is riding north with the\n   \n    Brotherhood Without Banners\n   \n   , through thick snow. They decide to take shelter for the night at an abandoned home but Sandor, recognizing the house, declares it unsafe.\n   \n    Beric Dondarrion\n   \n   dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter the house where they discover the corpses of the\n   Farmer\n   and his daughter\n   Sally\n   , whom he and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.\n  \n\n   Sandor recalls seeing Beric at the tournament at\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , and wonders aloud why Beric keeps getting resurrected, as there's nothing special about him. Beric confides that he does not know what\n   \n    R'hllor\n   \n   , the Lord of Light, is telling him. Sandor remarks that he does not believe in divine justice, citing the fate of the farmer and his daughter. Despite Sandor's fear of flames, Thoros tells him to look into the fire. He tells him that only the fire can show him what the Lord of Light wants him to see. At first, Sandor can only see burning logs, but then, to his own shock, he sees a\n   \n    Wall of Ice\n   \n   . He also sees a\n   \n    castle where the Wall meets the sea\n   \n   , a mountain that looks like an arrowhead, and thousands of the\n   \n    dead\n   \n   marching past. Beric asks Sandor if he now believes that they are here for a reason.\n  \n\n   Later,\n   \n    Thoros\n   \n   finds Sandor burying the dead farmer and his daughter Sally in the snow. Thoros deduces that Sandor knew the dead, but Sandor admits that he doesn't. The two of them bury the bodies together, and Sandor attempts to deliver an epitaph to\n   the Seven\n   , but can't remember the rest of the verse. Instead, he simply tells the dead that they deserve better.\n  \n\n\n    At Winterfell\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , the\n   \n    King in the North\n   \n\n    Jon Snow\n   \n   organizes the defense of the North against the Night King and his army of the dead. He asks that all maesters start searching for\n   \n    dragonglass\n   \n   , stressing it is now more valuable than gold due to its effectiveness against the White Walkers. Jon also requests that Tormund and his people man Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as Tormund and the other wildlings were present at Hardhome and have seen the Night King and Tormund agrees to defend this castle. Jon orders for all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 in his kingdom to be trained in combat in order to defend against the encroaching threat of the White Walkers. Because having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough, he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. When\n   Robett Glover\n   balks at the idea of arming his young granddaughter,\n   \n    Lady\n   \n\n    Lyanna Mormont\n   \n   remarks that she certainly will not remain idle and volunteers to help, giving her assurance that every girl on\n   \n    Bear Island\n   \n   will be trained alongside the boys. The words of the young lady once more remind the older lords of their place and they agree.\n  \n\n   The next order of business is the possibility of the Walkers getting past the wall; if they do, Jon notes that the first obstacles they encounter will be the castles of\n   \n    Last Hearth\n   \n   and\n   Karhold\n   , the seats belonging to the two Northern houses that fought alongside the Boltons. Lord\n   \n    Yohn Royce\n   \n   opines that the castles should be demolished for their lords' treachery, but\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   interjects that Last Hearth and Karhold committed no crimes and urges her half-brother to instead strip the\n   \n    Umbers\n   \n   and\n   \n    Karstarks\n   \n   of their castles as punishment for turning against the Starks. However, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and she reluctantly obliges. Jon then summons\n   Ned Umber\n   and\n   Alys Karstark\n   - both of whom are children who obviously played no part in their father's betrayal and are clearly terrified of what will happen to them. He asks them to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore.\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   watches the proceedings with a smile.\n  \n\n   In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies. He tells Sansa that while she is his sister and she can question his decisions, doing so when he is publicly addressing the Northern lords and ladies undermines his position with them. When Sansa responds that the late\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   did not tolerate dissent, Jon reassures her that h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Game of Thrones\n     \n\n      Season 5\n     \n\n\n\n      Episodes\n     \n\n      10\n     \n\n\n\n      Premiere\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       The Wars to Come\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Finale\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       Mother's Mercy\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Transmission dates\n     \n\n      April 12, 2015 to\n      June 14, 2015\n     \n\n\n\n      Production dates\n     \n\n      July 18, 2014\n      to\n      December 12, 2014\n     \n\n\n\n      DVD/Blu-ray\n     \n\n      March 15, 2016\n     \n\n\n     Episode guide\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Previous\n        \n\n         Next\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Season 4\n         \n\n\n         Season 6\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n   The\n   \n    fifth season\n   \n   of\n   \n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   was commissioned by\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   on April 8, 2014, following a substantial increase in audience figures between the\n   \n    third\n   \n   and\n   \n    fourth seasons\n   \n   .\n   The fifth and\n   sixth seasons\n   were commissioned simultaneously, the first time\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   has commissioned two seasons at once for a major drama series.\n  \n\n   The season consists of ten episodes.

The crazed boy-king\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   , Tywin's grandson, is also dead after being poisoned at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , and succeeded by his younger and more pliable brother,\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   . Queen\n   \n    Cersei Lannister\n   \n   succeeds her father as the head of\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   , and once again takes over as\n   Queen Regent\n   , as Tommen has yet to come of age. Cersei has been blocked by several powerful men over the years, including her husband King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   and his friend\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   , but due to her betrayals they are both dead. Now with even Tywin and Joffrey dead, and Tyrion fleeing the realm, there are no more checks on Cersei's power, and she is essentially the Ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms in all but name. However, Cersei is neither a master strategist nor a skilled diplomat (unlike her father and brother) and she faces mounting crises that would have strained even their abilities.\n  \n\n   House Lannister and its allies have managed to crush\n   \n    House Stark\n   \n   , but in many ways it was a pyrrhic victory. The\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   was already in\n   massive debt\n   to foreign banks before the war even began, and the Lannisters' immense wartime spending increased the crown's debts to crippling levels. The Lannisters must now desperately attempt to placate the\n   \n    Iron Bank of Braavos\n   \n   , by far the largest of the foreign banks, and the one which the crown owes most of its huge debts to.\n  \n\n   The game of thrones is, unfortunately, not a simple game of\n   \n    cyvasse\n   \n   in which the pieces can be quickly reassembled: vast swathes of Westeros have been devastated by civil war, and it may take a full generation for them to rebuild. The\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   , where most of the war was fought, have been reduced to a burned out husk. Nominally the Lannisters and their\n   \n    House Frey\n   \n   allies control the Riverlands, but it has been reduced to a lawless and corpse-filled devastation, hardly controlled by anyone. Winter is fast approaching, but instead of stockpiling harvests the past few years, the great lords have been busy destroying one of the main breadbasket regions of the Seven Kingdoms. Combined with the realm's massive debts to foreign banks, starvation level conditions are starting to set in for the\n   smallfolk\n   across the realm. Outraged by the willful indifference of their rulers to their well-being for so long, commoners are starting to fall back onto old cultural touchstones, channeling their frustration into religious fanaticism. A\n   popular disgust movement\n   spreads across Westeros, and makes its way to the capital.\n  \n\n   Adding to these woes is the increasing rivalry between the Lannisters and their Tyrell allies, specifically between Cersei and\n   \n    Margaery Tyrell\n   \n   . The Lannisters only managed to win on the battlefield with the armies and food resources won by their alliance with the\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   of the\n   \n    Reach\n   \n   . Now that Tywin is dead, and Margaery is soon to be King Tommen's queen, the Tyrells are no longer pretending to be polite to the Lannisters, but openly demanding greater concessions and key positions of power. With half of the Lannister armies slaughtered by\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   during the war, their financial resources depleted, and the Tyrells controlling the only major breadbasket region untouched by the war, the Lannisters are having to face the reality that the Tyrells hold numerous advantages over them. Just as\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   became king only to become dependent on the support of the Lannisters, the Lannisters have now become dependant on the Tyrells.\n  \n\n   Without the political acumen of Tywin or Tyrion, Queen Regent Cersei struggles to address these major challenges. Adding even further to her woes is that the king's\n   \n    small council\n   \n   has been gutted, with\n   Hand of the King\n   Tywin dead,\n   \n    Master of Coin\n   \n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   leaving for the\n   \n    Eyrie\n   \n   , and both Tyrion and\n   Master of Whisperers\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   fleeing the capital city. Of the original small council when the Lannisters first seized power, only\n   \n    Grand Maester\n   \n\n    Pycelle\n   \n   remains.\n  \n\n   Besides the Reach, only the regions which have remained neutral so far still have all of their armies and resources intact: the\n   \n    Vale\n   \n   , ruled by\n   \n    House Arryn\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   , ruled by\n   \n    House Martell\n   \n   . With nearly all the other Great Houses defeated or half-exhausted, the fresh armies of the Vale and Dorne can drastically alter the political playing field, depending on which side they choose to join.\n  \n\n   The ultimate result of the war was to exhaust the Starks, Lannisters, and other\n   \n    Great Houses\n   \n   of the Seven Kingdoms - exactly as Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish had planned. The secret architect of the conflict, it was Littlefinger who was responsible for poisoning Robert's Hand,\n   \n    Jon Arryn\n   \n   , by conspiring with his own wife\n   \n    Lysa Arryn\n   \n   . Littlefinger then engineered the betrayal of\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   , only to later assist\n   \n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   in assassinating King Joffrey\n   \n    at his own wedding\n   \n   . Baelish has now murdered Lysa, mere days after wedding her, and seized power over the Vale as regent for her young son. For the moment, Baelish remains in the Vale, consolidating his new hold over the Vale lords through his stepson\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   and his position as Lord Protector of the Vale. Alongside Baelish is the black-haired \"Alayne\", his ward and \"niece\" - secretly,\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   , who fell into Littlefinger's custody after he helped her escape her long imprisonment at Joffrey's royal court.\n  \n\n   In the deserts of the deep south of Westeros, the people of\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   demand vengeance for the death of Prince\n   \n    Oberyn\n   \n   , who died in a\n   trial by combat\n   at the hands of Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   . Leading the call to enter the war against the Lannisters are Oberyn's paramour,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and the eldest of\n   \n    his eight daughters\n   \n   :\n   Obara\n   ,\n   Nymeria\n   , and\n   \n    Tyene\n   \n   . But\n   \n    Doran Martell\n   \n   , the\n   Prince of Dorne\n   and Oberyn's older brother, continues to urge restraint. Further complicating the matter is that early in the war, the Lannisters bribed the Martells into staying neutral by offering a marriage-alliance, sending Cersei's daughter\n   \n    Myrcella\n   \n   to Dorne to betroth her to Doran's son\n   \n    Trystane\n   \n   . Myrcella is still a\n   ward\n   living in Dorne's capital,\n   \n    Sunspear\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The most dire situation in Westeros, however, is in the\n   \n    North\n   \n   and at the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   .

Another forthcoming Dunk & Egg story which he has fairly well planned out is called\n   \n    The Village Hero\n   \n   and takes place in the Riverlands.\n   Others he intends to write include\n   \n    The Sellsword\n   \n   ,\n   \n    The Champion\n   \n   ,\n   \n    The Kingsguard\n   \n   , and\n   \n    The Lord Commander\n   \n   , along with several as-yet untitled story ideas.\n  \n\n   There are at least nine more, unpublished novellas that Martin tentatively intends to write, for a total of twelve novellas once the entire series is finished.\n  \n\n\n    The Dance of the Dragons prequel novellas\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Princess and the Queen\n    \n    (2013)\n   \n\n\n     The Rogue Prince\n    \n    (2014)\n   \n\n\n   Martin began writing a detailed in-universe history text about the great Targaryen civil war known as the\n   \n    Dance of the Dragons\n   \n   (in which Targaryen fought Targaryen and dragon fought dragon) as a submission for an omnibus of collected works by several authors. In his own words he got a bit carried away, and ended up writing a detailed 80,000 word history even though the maximum length set for the novella submission was 30,000 pages. Martin had to focus only on one 30,000 work piece of the larger story, which he submitted as\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   (2013). This was later followed by\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   (2014), which is about 10,000 words long. Therefore, as of 2015 about half of what he wrote has not been released.\n  \n\n   The narrative conceit that Martin developed for these prequels is a drastic departure from his previous third person POV writing style. Instead, it is presented as an in-universe history text from Westeros written by \"Archmaester Gyldayn\". This format allowed Martin to write about events which were\n   \n    public\n   \n   knowledge to most people in Westeros, while still keeping the secret reasons why people actually did things unknown, or allowing secret betrayals to remain secret. To explain why only a 30,000 page section of the full 80,000 word text Martin wrote was not released, he gave the in-universe explanation that Gyldayn's history text was severely damaged and certain volumes lost, but that new sections are released as soon as the\n   \n    Citadel\n   \n   can locate copies of the missing sections.\n  \n\n   As a result,\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   takes place immediately before\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   , but it isn't really a true \"prequel\" because they were both written at the same time. Rather, it is as if the original draft was divided up into eight parts, of which\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   is \"part two through part four\" and\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   is \"part one\", but the parts were then released out of order. A reader can actually start with\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   , out of publication order, without being spoiled for later events, because this is the order the material was actually originally intended to be read in.\n  \n\n\n    Companion books\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Art of Ice and Fire, Volume I\n    \n    (2005).\n   \n\n\n     The Art of Ice and Fire, Volume II\n    \n    (2011).\n   \n\n\n     A Feast of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2012) - a companion cooking book, with a forward by Martin.\n   \n\n\n     The Lands of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2012) - a collection of map-posters, including exclusive maps previously unreleased with the novels, and the first full map of the known world.\n   \n\n\n     The World of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2014) - a sourcebook containing extensive amounts of previously unreleased information about Westeros, Essos, and other lands. Presented as an in-universe history book, giving a broad overview of the entire world.\n   \n\n\n\n      Fire & Blood\n     \n\n    (2018) - another in-universe history book: while the\n    \n     World\n    \n    book broadly covers everything from the North and the Reach to the Free Cities,\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    is focused in more detail on the three century reign of the Targaryen dynasty up to\n    \n     Aegon III\n    \n    . It is meant to be based on all of Martin's previously unpublished notes about the backstory of House Targaryen. The upcoming prequel series\n    \n\n      House of the Dragon\n     \n\n    is based on this book, specifically the events of the Dance of the Dragons.\n   \n\n\n     Fire & Blood, Volume Two\n    \n    (forthcoming) - a continuation of\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    up to the reign of\n    \n     Aerys II Targaryen\n    \n    , the \"Mad King.\" Martin revealed in July 2017 that\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    would have a second volume due to the size it had grown too, but that he won't continue with it until after the main novels are finished\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The World of Ice & Fire\n    \n\n\n\n\n    The World of Ice & Fire\n   \n   was published in 2014, presented as being an in-universe history book. It presents the expansive backstory of the\n   \n    known world\n   \n   of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   and beyond, much of it never revealed before in the main novels. It has not yet been mentioned within the main novel series, though it is considered to be fully part of the book-continuity canon.\n  \n\n   It was produced as an extensive collaboration between Martin himself and his long-time collaborators/fact-checkers, Elio Garcia and Linda Antonsson, who run the fansite Westeros.org. The project lasted nearly ten years: originally it was intended that Elio & Linda would write most of it as a summation of what was already mentioned in the novels, with Martin writing a few sidebars, but ultimately he produced vast new amounts of material both about the past of Westeros, and about the lands beyond it (actually expanding to detail the histories of lands\n   \n    east\n   \n   of the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   such as\n   \n    Yi Ti\n   \n   , which are barely even mentioned in the main novels).\n  \n\n   Originally the authors found it difficult to simply present an objective compendium/encyclopedia of events, because it would give away major revelations: would an article on\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   actually state that he isn't Ned Stark's son, but\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   's? Would an article about\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   explain why he\n   \n    really\n   \n   killed the Mad King, even though that is a secret revelation only given in the third novel? The answer they came up with was to present it as an in-universe history textbook written by \"Maester Yandel\". Yandel is the author-avatar of Elio & Linda, but at times he quotes from an earlier and more expansive history textbook written by \"Maester Gyldayn\" (the author avatar of George R.R. Martin). Thus the book isn't objective, but represents what is common knowledge to the average and reasonably well-informed lord in Westeros - i.e. most people actually know the general events of the\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   but in the core novels they don't halt the narrative for a dozen pages to give a long speech detailing everything about it. Similarly, most people in real life know the general outline of World War II, but characters in television and movies don't stop to give long speeches outlining the entire event, because they and everyone around them already knows it.\n  \n\n   Martin actually wrote a much longer history of\n   \n    House Targaryen\n   \n   which had to be edited down for the excerpts in\n   \n    The World of Ice & Fire\n   \n   - which were eventually collected into a volume called\n   \n    Fire & Blood\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Spin-offs\n   \n\n\n\n    Board \n\n\n\n\n   The\n   \n    known world\n   \n   of\n   \n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   has no overall or official name. Characters within the story simply refer to it as \"the world\". At the time of the series, the known world consists of three discovered continents:\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Essos\n   \n   , and\n   Sothoryos\n   . There are also numerous islands and archipelagos, including the\n   \n    Stepstones\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Summer Islands\n   \n   , and\n   Ib\n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Continents\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Seas and oceans\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Islands\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Westeros\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Essos\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Sothoryos\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Maps\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Climate and seasons\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Shape and size\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       Astronomy\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Setting and conception\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n       In the books\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       10\n      \n\n       See also\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Continents\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Westeros\n    \n    : Located in the far west of the known world, Westeros extends southwards from the northern polar icecap for approximately 3,000 miles. Most of the continent is unified as a political entity called the Seven Kingdoms, ruled from the King on the\n    \n     Iron Throne\n    \n    in the city of\n    \n     King's Landing\n    \n    . The northern border of the Seven Kingdoms is marked by The Wall, beyond which lies mountainous tundra inhabited by the Free Folk. Further north lies the Land of Always Winter which is assumed to be governed by White Walkers under the authority of the Night King. Most of the action in\n    \n     Game of Thrones\n    \n    occurs in Westeros.\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Essos\n    \n    : Separated from Westeros by the\n    \n     Narrow Sea\n    \n    , Essos extends eastwards for many thousands of miles. It is larger than Westeros but less densely populated. The western edge of the continent is controlled by the nine\n    \n     Free Cities\n    \n    , while the city-states of the\n    \n     Bay of Dragons\n    \n    are located in the south-central region. Further east is\n    \n     Qarth\n    \n    and the fabled\n    Jade Sea\n    , which Essos partially encloses. The far eastern coast of Essos is unexplored, as it lies beyond legendary\n    \n     Asshai\n    \n    and the forbidding\n    Shadow Lands\n    . Much of the continental interior west of the Jade Sea is ruled by the tribal warriors known as the\n    \n     Dothraki\n    \n    .\n   \n\n\n\n    Sothoryos\n    : With relatively little known about it, Sothoryos is located south of Essos, on the far side of the\n    \n     Summer Sea\n    \n    . It is a large continent consisting of deserts and jungles. It is said to be a haven for plagues and dangerous animals, and has not been explored much beyond the northern coastal regions.\n   \n\n\n\n    Seas and oceans\n   \n\n\n\n    The\n    Sunset Sea\n    lies to the west of Westeros. No-one has successfully crossed the Sunset Sea with any reliable information about any landmasses that might lie beyond.\n    \n     Arya Stark\n    \n    is currently exploring the sea.\n   \n\n\n\n    The\n    \n     Summer Sea\n    \n    lies to the south of Westeros and Essos, dividing the latter from Sothoryos. It contains the\n    \n     Summer Islands\n    \n    . The extent of the ocean south of the Summer Islands is unknown. Inlets of the Summer Sea include the Bay of Dragons and the\n    Gulf of Grief\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n    The\n    Shivering Sea\n    lies to the north-east of Westeros and the north of Essos, separating the latter from the northern polar ice cap.\n    Ibben\n    and\n    Skagos\n    are the most notable islands of size in the Shivering Sea. During the winter, the Shivering Sea becomes much more hostile to cross.\n   \n\n\n\n    The\n    \n     Narrow Sea\n    \n    divides Westeros from Essos, and also connects the Summer Sea in the south to the Shivering Sea in the north. While smaller than most of the other seas, it is still several hundred miles wide, presenting a formidable obstacle to military activity between the two continents. During winter, the Narrow Sea becomes difficult to cross because of storms and strong winds blowing from the north. Inlets of the Narrow Sea include\n    \n     Blackwater Bay\n    \n    , the\n    Sea of Dorne\n    , and the\n    Sea of Myrth\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n    The\n    Jade Sea\n    lies in the far east of the known world, beyond the\n    \n     plains of the Dothraki\n    \n    and\n    \n     Qarth\n    \n    . The Straits of Qarth (also called the Jade Gates) connect the Jade Sea with the Summer Sea, making Qarth a major hub for west-east sea trade.\n    \n     Yi Ti\n    \n    and\n    \n     Asshai\n    \n    are located along the coasts of the Jade Sea. Bold traders get rich from performing the \"trader's circle\" around the Jade Sea, trading between the powerful city-states and merchant kingdoms of the distant east and then carrying those riches back to Westeros and the Free Cities. Such a journey may take two years or more.\n   \n\n\n\n    Islands\n   \n\n\n   This is not a definitive list, but major islands or island groups of particular size and significance:\n  \n\n\n    Westeros\n   \n\n\n\n    The\n    \n     Arbor\n    \n    is a very large island off the south coast of Westeros. It is part of the Reach, held by\n    House Redwyne\n    and owing fealty to\n    \n     House Tyrell\n    \n    . It is one of the main wine-producing regions of the Seven Kingdoms.\n   \n\n\n     Bear Island\n    \n    lies off the north-western coast of Westeros. It is controlled by\n    \n     House Mormont\n    \n    and owes fealty to\n    \n     House Stark\n    \n    .\n   \n\n    The\n    \n     Iron Islands\n    \n    lie off the west coast of Westeros. They are one of the major regions of the continent and are controlled by one of the\n    \n     Great Houses\n    \n    of the Seven Kingdoms,\n    \n     House Greyjoy\n    \n    of\n    \n     Pyke\n    \n    .\n   \n\n    The\n    Three Sisters\n    are a collection of three small islands located between the North and the Vale, in a large bay called the\n    Bite\n    . For centuries they have been a haven for pirates and smugglers, but they are not nearly as large as the Iron Islands, so their raiding is looked down upon as mere piracy, and more of a nuisance than a threat. Officially they are ruled by the Vale, though their allegiance is always tenuous.\n   \n\n    Skagos\n    is a large island off the northeastern coast of Westeros. In theory it owes fealty to\n    \n     House Stark\n    \n    , but in practice its savage inhabitants (who are rumored to be\n    cannibals\n    ) are allowed to go their own way. Skagos is the largest of several islands in the archipelago, which also includes\n    Skane\n    .\n   \n\n    Tarth\n    ,\n    \n     Dragonstone\n    \n    , and Estermont are large islands in the Narrow Sea, off the eastern coasts of the\n    \n     Seven Kingdoms\n    \n    .\n   \n\n\n\n    Essos\n   \n\n\n\n    The\n    \n     Stepstones\n    \n    are a group of islands dividing the Narrow Sea from the Summer Sea. Legends say that in ancient times they formed a land bridge between Westeros and Essos. The present-day island chain is still one of the major paths of transit between Westeros and Essos, as merchant vessels follow their shallow waters instead of the open ocean, and any north-south sea traffic must also pass through them. The Stepstones are one of the world's major pirate dens, preying on all of the sea trade going around them. Efforts are often made to clear the Stepstones of pirates but new ones always replace them. The Free City of\n    \n     Tyrosh\n    \n    is located on the easternmost of the Stepstones. Several of the Free Cities, including Tyrosh,\n    \n     Lys\n    \n    and\n    \n     Myr\n    \n    , constantly compete for control of the islands, as does the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms on occasion, but any gains are temporary. Overall they remain a lawless no-man's land ruled by pirate-lords.\n   \n\n    The Free City of\n    Lorath\n    lies on an off-shore island in the Shivering Sea, while\n    \n     Lys\n    \n    is located on an off-shore island in the Summer Sea.\n   \n\n    Ibben\n    , sometimes called Ib, is the second largest island in the known world, home to a civilization of seafarers and whale-hunters. It is located thousands of miles east of Westeros, off the north coast of Essos (hundreds of miles north from\n    \n     Vaes Dothrak\n    \n    ). The Ibbenese trade across much of Essos and sometimes in Westeros as well. It is far too small to be considered a continent in its own right (about the size of real-life Iceland), and is loosely considered to be part of Essos.\n   \n\n    A great archipelago lying south-east of\n    \n     Volantis\n    \n    and west of the Bay of Dragons is the shattered remnant of the great\n    \n     Valyrian empire\n    \n    , obliterated four centuries ago in a cataclysmic volcanic event known as the\n    \n     Doom\n    \n    . Sailors from across the world know to give Valyria a wide berth, as volcanic activity continues there and the\n    Smoking Sea\n    between the islands is said to be uncrossable, as the fumes rising from the water can choke a man to death.\n   \n\n    New Ghis\n    , lying on an island on southeast to the Bay of Dragons, is the capital city of the resurgent Ghiscari Empire, which once sprawled across the nearby mainland until it was destroyed by the\n    \n     Valyrian Freehold\n    \n    five thousand years ago. Since Valyria's fall, the Ghiscari have sought to rebuild their empire with slow results.\n   \n\n\n\n    Sothoryos\n   \n\n\n\n    The\n    Basilisk Isles\n    lie off the north coast of Sothoryos and are said to be home to many dangerous and fabled creatures. The Basilisk Isles and nearby Naath are frequently raided by slaving ships from the north.\n   \n\n    Naath\n    is a major island off the north coast of Sothoryos, west of the Basilisk Isles chain.

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne.

At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred.

    "question": "who is the most famous character in the game of thrones?",
    "response": "Determining the \"most famous\" character in Game of Thrones can be subjective, as it depends on factors like cultural impact, fan discussions, and story prominence. Based on the context you provided, which highlights characters like Varys, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen, I'd recommend Jon Snow as one of the most iconic figures. He's often seen as a central hero due to his mysterious heritage and leadership role, as briefly mentioned in the context regarding his true parentage. However, Daenerys Targaryen is another strong contender, known for her quest to reclaim the Iron Throne and her dragons, which symbolize power and change in the story.\n\nTo figure this out yourself, you could:\n- Review the series' key events or character lists (like those in the context) to see who appears most frequently or drives major plotlines.\n- Consider fan polls or cultural references—Jon Snow and Daenerys are frequently discussed in popular media for their compelling arcs.\n- Explore official resources, such as the books by George R.R. Martin or episode guides, to learn more about these characters.\n\nIf you'd like, we can dive deeper into any specific character or discuss why fame varies based on personal perspectives!",

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out. Because the third novel was so long, the production team realized it would be imposs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Conleth Hill\n    \n\n\n      Date of birth\n     \n\n      November 24,1964\n     \n\n\n\n      Birthplace\n     \n\n      Ballycastle, Northern Ireland\n     \n\n\n\n      Role\n     \n\n\n       Varys\n      \n\n\n\n\n      First episode\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       Lord Snow\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Last episode\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       The Bells\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n\n       External links\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Conleth Seamus Eoin Croiston Hill\n   \n   (born 24 November 1964) is a Northern Irish film, stage and television actor.

As Martin explained, he had his own image of the characters and their mannerisms in his head for nearly 20 years before the live-action series began, and while he certainly\n   \n    enjoys\n   \n   the performance of many actors (even Sean Bean as Ned Stark), few of them come close to exactly how he pictured them acting in his mind.\n  \n\n\n    Credits\n   \n\n\n\n    Guest starring\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Game of Thrones\n         \n\n\n\n\n         Season 1\n        \n\n\n        credits\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Winter Is Coming\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Kingsroad\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Lord Snow\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Wolf and the Lion\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        A Golden Crown\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        You Win or You Die\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Pointy End\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Baelor\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Fire and Blood\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Starring\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Game of Thrones\n         \n\n\n\n\n         Season 2\n        \n\n\n        credits\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The North Remembers\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Night Lands\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        What Is Dead May Never Die\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Garden of Bones\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Ghost of Harrenhal\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Old Gods and the New\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        A Man Without Honor\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Prince of Winterfell\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Blackwater\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Valar Morghulis\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Game of Thrones\n         \n\n\n\n\n         Season 3\n        \n\n\n        credits\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Valar Dohaeris\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Dark Wings, Dark Words\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Walk of Punishment\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        And Now His Watch Is Ended\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Kissed by Fire\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Climb\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Bear and the Maiden Fair\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Second Sons\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Rains of Castamere\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Mhysa\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Game of Thrones\n         \n\n\n\n\n         Season 4\n        \n\n\n        credits\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Two Swords\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Lion and the Rose\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Breaker of Chains\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Oathkeeper\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        First of His Name\n       \n       *\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Laws of Gods and Men\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Mockingbird\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Mountain and the Viper\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Watchers on the Wall\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Children\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   * Uncredited.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Game of Thrones\n         \n\n\n\n\n         Season 5\n        \n\n\n        credits\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Wars to Come\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The House of Black and White\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        High Sparrow\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Sons of the Harpy\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Kill the Boy\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Gift\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Hardhome\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Dance of Dragons\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Mother's Mercy\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Game of Thrones\n         \n\n\n\n\n         Season 6\n        \n\n\n        credits\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Red Woman\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Home\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Oathbreaker\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Book of the Stranger\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Door\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Blood of My Blood\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Broken Man\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        No One\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Battle of the Bastards\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Winds of Winter\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Game of Thrones\n         \n\n\n\n\n         Season 7\n        \n\n\n        credits\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Dragonstone\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Stormborn\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Queen's Justice\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Spoils of War\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Eastwatch\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        Beyond the Wall\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Dragon and the Wolf\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Game of Thrones\n         \n\n\n\n\n         Season 8\n        \n\n\n        credits\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Winterfell\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Long Night\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Last of the Starks\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Bells\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n        The Iron Throne\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army.

When news of the events reached Sansa Stark in\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , she journeyed south with her brother Bran and her sworn sword,\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   .\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   , who was last seen at\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   with\n   \n    Gilly\n   \n   and\n   her son\n   , also journeyed south. Other lords and ladies had arrived in King's Landing as well to discuss the fate of Jon and Tyrion, and to decide the political future of Westeros.\n  \n\n\n    Election of Bran Stark\n   \n\n\n   When Tyrion Lannister was presented before the council, the Unsullied kept Jon Snow imprisoned, wanting to punish him themselves. Sansa Stark threatened the Unsullied with war if they attempted to harm Jon, to which their leader\n   \n    Grey Worm\n   \n   responded in equal measure.\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   Lady of the Iron Islands\n   and a Daenerys supporter, favored the Unsullied's view, but\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   threatened to kill Yara for even talking about hurting Jon. The situation was defused by\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   , but even he was unable to convince Grey Worm to let Jon go. Tyrion said that only the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms could deliver such justice, to which Grey Worm agreed.\n  \n\n   Daenerys's assassination had left the realm without a clear leader. Although this had essentially been the case for the previous six years - with the\n   War of the Five Kings\n   and the other conflicts that came afterwards - the near-extinction of three Great Houses (\n   \n    Targaryen\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Baratheon\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   ) had created huge uncertainty about who should inherit the throne.\n  \n\n   Members of the Great Council proposed three options for settling the succession:\n  \n\n\n\n     Edmure Tully\n    \n    ,\n    Lord of Riverrun\n    , set himself forward as a candidate for the crown, citing his battle experience as a veteran of two wars, as well as his experience with statecraft as credentials. This suggestion was promptly quashed by his niece, Sansa Stark, who sternly told her uncle to resume his seat.\n   \n\n    Samwell Tarly, who had served in the\n    \n     Night's Watch\n    \n    , suggested that all the people of Westeros select their own monarch, allowing each individual one vote in a democratic system (similar to the\n    Choosing\n    of\n    Lord Commanders\n    in the Watch, and a system that Tyrion had previously mentioned to Daenerys herself). This idea resulted in mocking laughter from the assembled lords, with Edmure and Yohn comparing the idea to giving votes to horses and dogs, and was quickly rejected as well.\n   \n\n    Finally, Tyrion suggested the idea of an\n    elective monarchy\n    , where the lords and ladies of the realm would congregate at the\n    Dragonpit\n    in\n    \n     King's Landing\n    \n    to determine a new king or queen following the death of the previous one (somewhat similar to the\n    Kingsmoot\n    ceremony of the\n    \n     Iron Islands\n    \n    , which Tyrion had also mentioned to Daenerys). This would also remove the possibility of unskilled or inexperienced leaders inheriting the throne. Tyrion claimed that nothing was better at uniting disparate people than a good story, and for that reason he suggested as monarch Brandon Stark, for his story of survival against extreme odds, and his abilities as the\n    \n     Three-Eyed Raven\n    \n    and keeper of the\n    \n     world\n    \n    's memory. Naming him \"Bran the Broken\" - for his inability to walk - Tyrion's idea was swiftly appreciated and accepted by the members of the council.\n   \n\n\n   Despite the support gained for Brandon Stark, his sister Sansa was the only assembled member who did not immediately accept his crown. Saying that the\n   Northmen\n   had suffered too much to ever accept the rule of an outsider again (as could well happen in the future with an elective monarchy), she demanded that the North once again become its own sovereign kingdom, \"as it was for thousands of years.\" This was granted by Brandon, who was thereafter hailed as\n   \n    Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm.\n   \n\n\n\n    Secession of the North\n   \n\n\n   The notion of independence for the Kingdom of the North had been a prevailing issue for many years, ever since\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   beheaded Lord\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   , and Eddard's eldest son\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   was forced to raise his banners in rebellion. Due to his purported\n   illegitimacy\n   , Joffrey's claim to the throne was contested, but the northerners did not wish to support the claims of either\n   \n    Stannis\n   \n   or\n   \n    Renly\n   \n   , the late King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   's brothers. Instead, they crowned Robb King in the North, and declared themselves a free and independent kingdom.\n  \n\n   Robb Stark's war for independence would be successful until he broke his betrothal with\n   \n    Roslin Frey\n   \n   to marry\n   \n    Talisa Maegyr\n   \n   , a\n   \n    Volantene\n   \n   noblewoman whom he had met on the campaign. As a result, Lord\n   \n    Walder Frey\n   \n   (Roslin's father) orchestrated the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   with\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , a successful massacre of the northmen that dined within his halls when Edmure Tully was married to Roslin instead. Both Robb and his mother\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   were killed, intensifying the Stark-Lannister blood feud.\n   Following the Red Wedding,\n   \n    Roose Bolton\n   \n   was named as\n   Lord Paramount of the North\n   and\n   \n    Lord of Winterfell\n   \n   , replacing the Starks and earning the loathing of many northern Houses, whose banners had been pledged to the Stark cause.\n  \n\n   Roose would later be murdered in a conspiracy by his legitimized bastard son,\n   \n    Ramsay Bolton\n   \n   , who would continue to rule the North through fear tactics and brutal violence.

    "question": "How many books are in the Game of Thrones series?",
    "response": "The \"Game of Thrones series\" typically refers to the TV adaptation, but based on your question, you're likely asking about the source material, which is the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R.R. Martin.\n\nAs of the latest available information:\n- There are **5 published main series novels**:\n  1. A Game of Thrones (1996)\n  2. A Clash of Kings (1998)\n  3. A Storm of Swords (2000)\n  4. A Feast for Crows (2005)\n  5. A Dance with Dragons (2011)\n- Additionally, **2 more novels are planned** to complete the series: The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring, though release dates for these have not been confirmed.\n\nIn total, the main series is expected to have **7 books** once completed. Note that there are also prequel novellas (e.g., Tales of Dunk and Egg), companion books (e.g., The World of Ice & Fire), and other related works, but these are not part of the core series. If you're planning to read the books, I recommend starting with the main novels, as they form the primary storyline that the TV series adapts. If you have more questions, like how the books compare to the TV show, feel free to ask!",

Another forthcoming Dunk & Egg story which he has fairly well planned out is called\n   \n    The Village Hero\n   \n   and takes place in the Riverlands.\n   Others he intends to write include\n   \n    The Sellsword\n   \n   ,\n   \n    The Champion\n   \n   ,\n   \n    The Kingsguard\n   \n   , and\n   \n    The Lord Commander\n   \n   , along with several as-yet untitled story ideas.\n  \n\n   There are at least nine more, unpublished novellas that Martin tentatively intends to write, for a total of twelve novellas once the entire series is finished.\n  \n\n\n    The Dance of the Dragons prequel novellas\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Princess and the Queen\n    \n    (2013)\n   \n\n\n     The Rogue Prince\n    \n    (2014)\n   \n\n\n   Martin began writing a detailed in-universe history text about the great Targaryen civil war known as the\n   \n    Dance of the Dragons\n   \n   (in which Targaryen fought Targaryen and dragon fought dragon) as a submission for an omnibus of collected works by several authors. In his own words he got a bit carried away, and ended up writing a detailed 80,000 word history even though the maximum length set for the novella submission was 30,000 pages. Martin had to focus only on one 30,000 work piece of the larger story, which he submitted as\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   (2013). This was later followed by\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   (2014), which is about 10,000 words long. Therefore, as of 2015 about half of what he wrote has not been released.\n  \n\n   The narrative conceit that Martin developed for these prequels is a drastic departure from his previous third person POV writing style. Instead, it is presented as an in-universe history text from Westeros written by \"Archmaester Gyldayn\". This format allowed Martin to write about events which were\n   \n    public\n   \n   knowledge to most people in Westeros, while still keeping the secret reasons why people actually did things unknown, or allowing secret betrayals to remain secret. To explain why only a 30,000 page section of the full 80,000 word text Martin wrote was not released, he gave the in-universe explanation that Gyldayn's history text was severely damaged and certain volumes lost, but that new sections are released as soon as the\n   \n    Citadel\n   \n   can locate copies of the missing sections.\n  \n\n   As a result,\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   takes place immediately before\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   , but it isn't really a true \"prequel\" because they were both written at the same time. Rather, it is as if the original draft was divided up into eight parts, of which\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   is \"part two through part four\" and\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   is \"part one\", but the parts were then released out of order. A reader can actually start with\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   , out of publication order, without being spoiled for later events, because this is the order the material was actually originally intended to be read in.\n  \n\n\n    Companion books\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Art of Ice and Fire, Volume I\n    \n    (2005).\n   \n\n\n     The Art of Ice and Fire, Volume II\n    \n    (2011).\n   \n\n\n     A Feast of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2012) - a companion cooking book, with a forward by Martin.\n   \n\n\n     The Lands of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2012) - a collection of map-posters, including exclusive maps previously unreleased with the novels, and the first full map of the known world.\n   \n\n\n     The World of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2014) - a sourcebook containing extensive amounts of previously unreleased information about Westeros, Essos, and other lands. Presented as an in-universe history book, giving a broad overview of the entire world.\n   \n\n\n\n      Fire & Blood\n     \n\n    (2018) - another in-universe history book: while the\n    \n     World\n    \n    book broadly covers everything from the North and the Reach to the Free Cities,\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    is focused in more detail on the three century reign of the Targaryen dynasty up to\n    \n     Aegon III\n    \n    . It is meant to be based on all of Martin's previously unpublished notes about the backstory of House Targaryen. The upcoming prequel series\n    \n\n      House of the Dragon\n     \n\n    is based on this book, specifically the events of the Dance of the Dragons.\n   \n\n\n     Fire & Blood, Volume Two\n    \n    (forthcoming) - a continuation of\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    up to the reign of\n    \n     Aerys II Targaryen\n    \n    , the \"Mad King.\" Martin revealed in July 2017 that\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    would have a second volume due to the size it had grown too, but that he won't continue with it until after the main novels are finished\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The World of Ice & Fire\n    \n\n\n\n\n    The World of Ice & Fire\n   \n   was published in 2014, presented as being an in-universe history book. It presents the expansive backstory of the\n   \n    known world\n   \n   of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   and beyond, much of it never revealed before in the main novels. It has not yet been mentioned within the main novel series, though it is considered to be fully part of the book-continuity canon.\n  \n\n   It was produced as an extensive collaboration between Martin himself and his long-time collaborators/fact-checkers, Elio Garcia and Linda Antonsson, who run the fansite Westeros.org. The project lasted nearly ten years: originally it was intended that Elio & Linda would write most of it as a summation of what was already mentioned in the novels, with Martin writing a few sidebars, but ultimately he produced vast new amounts of material both about the past of Westeros, and about the lands beyond it (actually expanding to detail the histories of lands\n   \n    east\n   \n   of the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   such as\n   \n    Yi Ti\n   \n   , which are barely even mentioned in the main novels).\n  \n\n   Originally the authors found it difficult to simply present an objective compendium/encyclopedia of events, because it would give away major revelations: would an article on\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   actually state that he isn't Ned Stark's son, but\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   's? Would an article about\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   explain why he\n   \n    really\n   \n   killed the Mad King, even though that is a secret revelation only given in the third novel? The answer they came up with was to present it as an in-universe history textbook written by \"Maester Yandel\". Yandel is the author-avatar of Elio & Linda, but at times he quotes from an earlier and more expansive history textbook written by \"Maester Gyldayn\" (the author avatar of George R.R. Martin). Thus the book isn't objective, but represents what is common knowledge to the average and reasonably well-informed lord in Westeros - i.e. most people actually know the general events of the\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   but in the core novels they don't halt the narrative for a dozen pages to give a long speech detailing everything about it. Similarly, most people in real life know the general outline of World War II, but characters in television and movies don't stop to give long speeches outlining the entire event, because they and everyone around them already knows it.\n  \n\n   Martin actually wrote a much longer history of\n   \n    House Targaryen\n   \n   which had to be edited down for the excerpts in\n   \n    The World of Ice & Fire\n   \n   - which were eventually collected into a volume called\n   \n    Fire & Blood\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Spin-offs\n   \n\n\n\n    Board \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   is an American fantasy drama television series produced by the\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   cable network.

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out.

His parents were Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin, who also had two daughters, George's sisters Darleen and Janet. The family was of mixed Irish and Italian heritage. Raymond worked as a longshoreman, and the family lived in a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks. The family followed Roman Catholicism, and at the age of 13 George received the confirmation name \"Richard\", hence \"George Raymond Richard Martin\" (in later years, when working on the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series, George has described himself as a \"\n   lapsed Catholic\n   \").\n  \n\n   He became an avid fan of comic books while in high school:\n   \n    Fantastic Four\n   \n   #20 (November 1963) contains a letter he wrote to the editor. He subsequently became involved in the comic book fanzine scene, and attended the very first Comi-Con convention in New York City. In his youth he also became a fan of science fiction and fantasy literature, such as the works of Robert Heinlein, Robert E. Howard, Jack Vance and J.R.R. Tolkien. After college he held jobs as a journalist, chess tournament organizer and English teacher at a Christian women's college. He was married briefly in the mid-1970s, and has lived with his partner Parris in Santa Fe since 1981. They married in January 2011.\n  \n\n   Martin has chosen a turtle as his personal sigil, and he is often seen wearing a hat with a turtle pin on it. As Martin himself explained at the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   panel for San Diego Comic Con 2012:\n  \n\n   As he also explained in an interview with\n   \n    Financial Times\n   \n   :\n  \n\n\n    Short fiction\n   \n\n\n   Martin began writing his first short fiction in the late 1960s, but wasn't published professionally until 1971. A lot of Martin's early work was set in the 'Thousand Worlds', an SF backdrop set millennia into the future where humanity has slowly spread into space and encountered other races. His 1973 story from this setting,\n   \n    A Song for Lya\n   \n   , won Martin his first Hugo Award. In 1980 he achieved significant acclaim when\n   \n    Sandkings\n   \n   won both the Hugo and the Nebula for Best Novelette and\n   \n    The Way of Cross and Dragon\n   \n   won the Hugo for Best Short Story.\n   \n    Sandkings\n   \n   was for many years his best-known story and was adapted for television as the pilot episode of the new\n   \n    Outer Limits\n   \n   in 1996.\n  \n\n\n    Novels\n   \n\n\n   Martin moved into novel-length fiction with\n   \n    Dying of the Light\n   \n   , a sci-fi novel set in the Thousand Worlds milieu. It was published in 1977 and was nominated for a Hugo the following year. He followed up on this book with\n   \n    Windhaven\n   \n   in 1981, co-written with Lisa Tuttle. In 1982 he achieved significant critical and commercial success with\n   \n    Fevre Dream\n   \n   , a vampire novel set on the Mississippi around the time of the American Civil War which was nominated for the World Fantasy Award. His publishers eagerly signed up his follow-up,\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   , about a rock band whose comeback tour has supernatural overtones, but the book was a commercial failure, despite critical acclaim and a second World Fantasy Award nomination. Although Martin successfully sold a collection of his Thousand World stories featuring the character of Haviland Tuf as\n   \n    Tuf Voyaging\n   \n   , his novel career seemed to have stalled at that point.\n  \n\n\n    Hollywood\n   \n\n\n   The failure of\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   had a significant impact on Martin's fortunes, and there was little excitement over his next novel-in-progress,\n   \n    Black and White and Red All Over\n   \n   . However, television producer Phil DeGuere was impressed enough by\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   to option it as a movie script, and in 1985 asked Martin to contribute to a new project he was developing for CBS,\n   \n    The New Twilight Zone\n   \n   . Martin, although a huge fan of the original Rod Serling series, was hesitant to enter the competitive field of scriptwriting, but was convinced by the involvement of another writer he respected enormously, Harlan Ellison, as well as DeGuere's promise of backstage passes to Grateful Dead concerts. When Ellison abruptly left the series due to creative clashes, Martin was brought in as a staff writer. When the show unexpectedly returned for a second season, Martin was bumped up to story editor, but the series was then taken off the air for \"retooling\" for its third season.\n  \n\n   George R.R. Martin was not involved in the third season as Ron Koslow, a fan of his\n   \n    Twilight Zone\n   \n   work, had recruited him to be involved in his new urban fantasy series,\n   \n    Beauty and the Beast\n   \n   , starring Linda Hamilton, Ron Perlman and\n   Roy Dotrice\n   . Martin started as Executive Story Consultant and ended up as Supervising Producer on the third and final season. During his time on the show, he gained a reputation for being unafraid to kill off major characters (to fan's ire) and for showing the darker side of humanity. After the show ended, Martin had gained enough Hollywood credentials to attempt to launch his own show,\n   \n    Doorways\n   \n   , which eventually had a pilot produced by ABC in 1992. The pilot was never screened and the show never made, although a later series,\n   \n    Sliders\n   \n   , explored similar ideas.\n  \n\n\n    Roleplaying and\n    \n     Wild Cards\n    \n\n\n\n   Martin's first involvement with roleplaying games came when Scottish science fiction and fantasy writer Charles Stross 'borrowed' the githzerai and githyanki from his Thousand Worlds setting to use as\n   \n    Dungeons and Dragons\n   \n   monsters in an article for\n   \n    Dragon Magazine\n   \n   . They proved popular and have remained a D&D mainstay ever since, although Martin was unaware of the homage until many years later.\n  \n\n   Martin himself was introduced to roleplaying games in the late 1970s by Parris. His first game was\n   \n    Call of Cthulhu\n   \n   by Chaosium, and he was soon running his own game. However, he put this to one side when he was introduced to\n   \n    SuperWorlds\n   \n   by Victor Milán. His gaming group became enamored of the game and setting, and Martin eventually hit on the idea of developing their campaign into a shared-world anthology series. This idea proved successful, since such anthology series were all the rage in the mid-1980s thanks to the success of Lynn Abbey and Robert Asprin's\n   \n    Thieves World\n   \n   series, and Martin further enhanced the book by calling in experienced writers such as Roger Zelazny and Howard Waldrop to help expand it.\n   \n    Wild Cards\n   \n   was released in 1986 and was an immediate hit, and was succeeded by fourteen further books in the series, released over the next nine years. Despite very strong sales to start with, by the mid-1990s interest was ",

    "question": "What is the premise of game of thrones? Is it based on real countries/places?",
    "response": "The premise of *Game of Thrones* is a complex fantasy drama set in the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, where noble houses vie for control of the Iron Throne amidst political intrigue, brutal wars, family rivalries, and supernatural threats like dragons and White Walkers. It follows multiple storylines involving characters from various houses, such as the Starks, Lannisters, and Targaryens, as they navigate power struggles, alliances, and survival in a medieval-inspired world.\n\nNo, *Game of Thrones* is not directly based on real countries or places; it is a fictional universe created by George R.R. Martin in his \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" novels. While elements of the story, such as the wars and social structures, may be inspired by real historical events like the Wars of the Roses, the settings (e.g., Westeros) are entirely imaginary and not direct representations of actual locations.",

The crazed boy-king\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   , Tywin's grandson, is also dead after being poisoned at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , and succeeded by his younger and more pliable brother,\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   . Queen\n   \n    Cersei Lannister\n   \n   succeeds her father as the head of\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   , and once again takes over as\n   Queen Regent\n   , as Tommen has yet to come of age. Cersei has been blocked by several powerful men over the years, including her husband King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   and his friend\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   , but due to her betrayals they are both dead. Now with even Tywin and Joffrey dead, and Tyrion fleeing the realm, there are no more checks on Cersei's power, and she is essentially the Ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms in all but name. However, Cersei is neither a master strategist nor a skilled diplomat (unlike her father and brother) and she faces mounting crises that would have strained even their abilities.\n  \n\n   House Lannister and its allies have managed to crush\n   \n    House Stark\n   \n   , but in many ways it was a pyrrhic victory. The\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   was already in\n   massive debt\n   to foreign banks before the war even began, and the Lannisters' immense wartime spending increased the crown's debts to crippling levels. The Lannisters must now desperately attempt to placate the\n   \n    Iron Bank of Braavos\n   \n   , by far the largest of the foreign banks, and the one which the crown owes most of its huge debts to.\n  \n\n   The game of thrones is, unfortunately, not a simple game of\n   \n    cyvasse\n   \n   in which the pieces can be quickly reassembled: vast swathes of Westeros have been devastated by civil war, and it may take a full generation for them to rebuild. The\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   , where most of the war was fought, have been reduced to a burned out husk. Nominally the Lannisters and their\n   \n    House Frey\n   \n   allies control the Riverlands, but it has been reduced to a lawless and corpse-filled devastation, hardly controlled by anyone. Winter is fast approaching, but instead of stockpiling harvests the past few years, the great lords have been busy destroying one of the main breadbasket regions of the Seven Kingdoms. Combined with the realm's massive debts to foreign banks, starvation level conditions are starting to set in for the\n   smallfolk\n   across the realm. Outraged by the willful indifference of their rulers to their well-being for so long, commoners are starting to fall back onto old cultural touchstones, channeling their frustration into religious fanaticism. A\n   popular disgust movement\n   spreads across Westeros, and makes its way to the capital.\n  \n\n   Adding to these woes is the increasing rivalry between the Lannisters and their Tyrell allies, specifically between Cersei and\n   \n    Margaery Tyrell\n   \n   . The Lannisters only managed to win on the battlefield with the armies and food resources won by their alliance with the\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   of the\n   \n    Reach\n   \n   . Now that Tywin is dead, and Margaery is soon to be King Tommen's queen, the Tyrells are no longer pretending to be polite to the Lannisters, but openly demanding greater concessions and key positions of power. With half of the Lannister armies slaughtered by\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   during the war, their financial resources depleted, and the Tyrells controlling the only major breadbasket region untouched by the war, the Lannisters are having to face the reality that the Tyrells hold numerous advantages over them. Just as\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   became king only to become dependent on the support of the Lannisters, the Lannisters have now become dependant on the Tyrells.\n  \n\n   Without the political acumen of Tywin or Tyrion, Queen Regent Cersei struggles to address these major challenges. Adding even further to her woes is that the king's\n   \n    small council\n   \n   has been gutted, with\n   Hand of the King\n   Tywin dead,\n   \n    Master of Coin\n   \n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   leaving for the\n   \n    Eyrie\n   \n   , and both Tyrion and\n   Master of Whisperers\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   fleeing the capital city. Of the original small council when the Lannisters first seized power, only\n   \n    Grand Maester\n   \n\n    Pycelle\n   \n   remains.\n  \n\n   Besides the Reach, only the regions which have remained neutral so far still have all of their armies and resources intact: the\n   \n    Vale\n   \n   , ruled by\n   \n    House Arryn\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   , ruled by\n   \n    House Martell\n   \n   . With nearly all the other Great Houses defeated or half-exhausted, the fresh armies of the Vale and Dorne can drastically alter the political playing field, depending on which side they choose to join.\n  \n\n   The ultimate result of the war was to exhaust the Starks, Lannisters, and other\n   \n    Great Houses\n   \n   of the Seven Kingdoms - exactly as Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish had planned. The secret architect of the conflict, it was Littlefinger who was responsible for poisoning Robert's Hand,\n   \n    Jon Arryn\n   \n   , by conspiring with his own wife\n   \n    Lysa Arryn\n   \n   . Littlefinger then engineered the betrayal of\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   , only to later assist\n   \n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   in assassinating King Joffrey\n   \n    at his own wedding\n   \n   . Baelish has now murdered Lysa, mere days after wedding her, and seized power over the Vale as regent for her young son. For the moment, Baelish remains in the Vale, consolidating his new hold over the Vale lords through his stepson\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   and his position as Lord Protector of the Vale. Alongside Baelish is the black-haired \"Alayne\", his ward and \"niece\" - secretly,\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   , who fell into Littlefinger's custody after he helped her escape her long imprisonment at Joffrey's royal court.\n  \n\n   In the deserts of the deep south of Westeros, the people of\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   demand vengeance for the death of Prince\n   \n    Oberyn\n   \n   , who died in a\n   trial by combat\n   at the hands of Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   . Leading the call to enter the war against the Lannisters are Oberyn's paramour,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and the eldest of\n   \n    his eight daughters\n   \n   :\n   Obara\n   ,\n   Nymeria\n   , and\n   \n    Tyene\n   \n   . But\n   \n    Doran Martell\n   \n   , the\n   Prince of Dorne\n   and Oberyn's older brother, continues to urge restraint. Further complicating the matter is that early in the war, the Lannisters bribed the Martells into staying neutral by offering a marriage-alliance, sending Cersei's daughter\n   \n    Myrcella\n   \n   to Dorne to betroth her to Doran's son\n   \n    Trystane\n   \n   . Myrcella is still a\n   ward\n   living in Dorne's capital,\n   \n    Sunspear\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The most dire situation in Westeros, however, is in the\n   \n    North\n   \n   and at the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   . The\n   massive assault  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   is an American fantasy drama television series produced by the\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   cable network. It is based on the novel series\n   \n\n     A Song of Ice and Fire\n    \n\n   , written by\n   \n    George R.R. Martin\n   \n   , who serves as a producer, creative consultant and scriptwriter on the television series.\n   \n    David Benioff\n   \n   and\n   \n    D.B.

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out.

It consists of ten episodes and began filming on July 8, 2013.\n   It concluded filming on November 21, 2013.\n   \n    David Benioff\n   \n   and\n   \n    D.B.

Robb's mother\n   \n    Catelyn\n   \n   and his wife\n   \n    Talisa\n   \n   , along with most of the Northern leadership were also killed at the massacre now known as the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   , along with the entire Northern army.\n  \n\n   Having already defeated\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   at the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   and secured southern Westeros,\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   stands triumphant. The crazed boy-king\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   gloats, though the victory truly belongs to his grandfather, Lord\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Hand of the King\n   \n   and the real power behind the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   . As reward for their betrayal, Tywin has granted the Boltons rule of the\n   \n    North\n   \n   , and the Freys with nominal rule of\n   \n    Riverrun\n   \n   , though the castle remains under the command of\n   \n    Brynden Tully\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Though the mainland of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   is mostly under Lannister control, there are still two factions defying them: the\n   \n    Greyjoys\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Baratheons\n   \n   . Ironborn occupiers remaining in the North are being hunted down by\n   \n    Ramsay Snow\n   \n   , bastard son of\n   \n    Roose Bolton\n   \n   . Ramsay holds\n   \n    Theon Greyjoy\n   \n   hostage, horribly torturing him at whim, but\n   \n    Balon Greyjoy\n   \n   considers his son as good as dead.\n  \n\n\n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   , as the rightful heir to his older brother King\n   \n    Robert\n   \n   , still refuses to surrender, despite having only the remnants of an army. However, following the advice of\n   \n    Melisandre\n   \n   , he has focused his attention of the threat of the\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   marching against the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The Lannisters only managed to win on the battlefield with the key support of\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   of the\n   \n    Reach\n   \n   , which they won through promising a marriage-alliance between King Joffrey and\n   \n    Margaery Tyrell\n   \n   , daughter of Lord\n   \n    Mace Tyrell\n   \n   . Queen Regent Cersei fears - correctly - that just as the Baratheons became dependent on the Lannisters after\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , the Lannisters are starting to become dependent on the Tyrells, who are already insinuating themselves into positions of power at\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . A royal wedding is to be held between Joffrey and Margaery, which will\n   \n    confirm the future of the realm\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The only two kingdoms which have remained entirely aloof from the war so far are the\n   \n    Vale of Arryn\n   \n   and\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   . While\n   \n    Lysa Arryn\n   \n   chose to remain neutral, former\n   \n    Master of Coin\n   \n   and new\n   Lord of Harrenhal\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   has been sent by Lord Tywin to woo her with a marriage proposal, now that he's a high lord and a suitable match for the Lady Regent of the Vale. Nevertheless only Littlefinger knows what Littlefinger is plotting.\n  \n\n   For their own part,\n   \n    House Martell\n   \n   of\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   has loathed the Lannisters ever since the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , when Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   raped and killed\n   \n    Elia Martell\n   \n   - sister of\n   \n    Doran Martell\n   \n   , the ruling\n   Prince of Dorne\n   - and Lord Tywin did nothing to punish him. During the War of the Five Kings\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   prevented Dorne from declaring for any of House Lannister's enemies by sending Princess\n   \n    Myrcella\n   \n   to\n   \n    Sunspear\n   \n   as part of her betrothal to Prince\n   \n    Trystane Martell\n   \n   , and in return, the Martells were promised a seat on the\n   \n    small council\n   \n   . To the consternation of the Lannisters, a large Dornish embassy arrives in King's Landing to claim their due - but instead of the elderly Prince Doran, his brash younger brother Prince\n   \n    Oberyn\n   \n   comes to claim the council seat. Oberyn loves the ladies, he loves the boys, but most of all he loved his sister Elia, and the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.\n  \n\n   Meanwhile, across the\n   \n    Narrow Sea\n   \n   in\n   \n    Slaver's Bay\n   \n   , perhaps the greatest threat to Lannister rule is rapidly growing in strength.\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   now commands not just three live\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   - who are starting to grow large enough to serve as decisive weapons of war - but also an army of eight thousand\n   \n    Unsullied\n   \n   warrior-eunuchs. For now, Queen Daenerys is carving a path through Slaver's Bay - not of conquest but of liberation. As functionally once a slave herself, Daenerys is determined to free the downtrodden\n   \n    slaves\n   \n   of the region. First\n   \n    Astapor\n   \n   and then\n   \n    Yunkai\n   \n   fell before Daenerys's forces, and hundreds of thousands of freed slaves now flock to her banner. Yet Daenerys must now face the last and greatest of the slaver-cities,\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   - and unlike her previous victories, they have had time to prepare for her arrival.\n  \n\n   Far to the north, beyond the politics and meaningless feuds of the south, the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   and the dwindling\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   are all that stand between the Seven Kingdoms and the horrors beyond. The\n   \n    White Walkers\n   \n   have emerged in force, leading their armies of\n   \n    wights\n   \n   . The\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   have rallied behind\n   \n    King-Beyond-the-Wall\n   \n\n    Mance Rayder\n   \n   in an attempt to flee south, knowing that as the White Walkers advance, anyone who remain in the lands\n   \n    beyond the Wall\n   \n   will die and become part of the undead host. Mance's wildling army now numbers in the tens of thousands, and is determined to force its way through the Wall to reach the safety of the south. All that stands between the Seven Kingdoms and this barbarian invasion is the Night's Watch, whose numbers and leadership were recently devastated with the deaths of a third of their number and that of Lord Commander\n   \n    Jeor Mormont\n   \n   .\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   do what they can to prepare\n   \n    Castle Black\n   \n   for the\n   \n    massive wildling attack\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Not only are the Night's Watch outnumbered and their remaining leadership fractured, but advanced raiding bands of wildlings have infiltrated\n   \n    behind\n   \n   the Wall by climbing over it, preparing to attack the weakly defended southern side of Castle Black. These warbands are led by\n   \n    Tormund\n   \n   and the fearsome\n   Styr\n   , Magnar of\n   Thenn\n   - as well as Jon Snow's ex-lover\n   \n    Ygritte\n   \n   , whom he betrayed when he revealed his true loyalty and returned to the N",

    "question": "What is the basis of the Game of Thrones seris?",
    "response": "The Game of Thrones series is based on George R.R. Martin's epic fantasy novels, \"A Song of Ice and Fire,\" which began with the first book, \"A Game of Thrones,\" published in 1996. These novels form the foundation, weaving a complex narrative inspired by medieval history, drawing from real-world events like the Wars of the Roses, and exploring themes of power struggles, loyalty, and conflict in a fictional world called Westeros.\n\nKey elements from the series include the Iron Throne and the Kingsguard, as described in the context. The Iron Throne symbolizes ultimate power and the monarchy's authority, forged from conquered swords to represent the unification of the Seven Kingdoms under House Targaryen, and it drives much of the story's central conflicts as various characters vie for control. The Kingsguard, an elite group of seven knights sworn to protect the king, embodies themes of unwavering loyalty and the moral complexities of duty, as seen in figures like Brienne of Tarth and historical members such as Jaime Lannister, who face internal and external conflicts that highlight betrayal and honor.\n\nTogether, these elements contribute to the series' overarching themes: the pursuit of power often leads to destruction, loyalty can be tested by personal ambitions, and conflicts arise from human flaws, making the story a profound exploration of political intrigue and human nature.",

Their duty is to protect the king and the royal family from harm at all times. The Kingsguard swear the most holy of vows to fulfill their sacred duty, and - in theory - are meant to be the living exemplars of the pinnacle of knightly virtues. Like the brothers of the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   , members of the Kingsguard are sworn for life and are forbidden from owning land, taking wives, or fathering children.\n  \n\n   The Kingsguard wear signature all-white cloaks, and gold armor with extensive white enameling. For this reason they are sometimes colloquially called the \"White Cloaks\", or the \"White Swords\". During the reign of\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   , the Kingsguard, like Ser\n   Arthur Dayne\n   and\n   Gerold Hightower\n   , wore special\n   \n    Targaryen\n   \n   armor.\n  \n\n   In the three centuries prior to the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   , the Seven Kingdoms simply never had a ruling female monarch, but the succession of\n   \n    Cersei Lannister\n   \n   gave the formal name of the institution to be the \"\n   \n    Queensguard\n   \n   \".\n  \n\n   The Kingsguard was created 300 years ago by the first Targaryen king,\n   \n    Aegon the Conqueror\n   \n   , when he united the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   under a single monarchy and established the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The deeds of every knight who has ever served in the Kingsguard is kept in a large book called\n   \n    The Book of Brothers\n   \n   . The book is stored in\n   White Sword Tower\n   , and it is the responsibility of the current Lord Commander to keep all entries updated.\n  \n\n   The Kingsguard is led by the\n   \n    Lord Commander\n   \n   , currently\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   .\n   The Lord Commander appears to have no marks on his armor to distinguish him from other members.\n   Under normal circumstances, the Lord Commander sits on the\n   \n    small council\n   \n   as the King's advisor in military matters. However,\n   \n    Barristan Selmy\n   \n   did not sit on King Robert's small council due to Ser Barristan's previous allegiance to the Targaryen dynasty.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Known past members\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Under Aenys I Targaryen\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Under Viserys I Targaryen\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Under Aegon II Targaryen\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Under Aegon IV Targaryen\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Under Daeron II Targaryen\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Under Aegon V Targaryen\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.7\n        \n\n         Under Aerys II Targaryen\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.8\n        \n\n         Under Robert I Baratheon\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.9\n        \n\n         Under Joffrey I Baratheon\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.10\n        \n\n         Under Tommen I Baratheon\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.11\n        \n\n         Under Cersei I Lannister\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Current members\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Rival Kingsguards\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Rhaenyra Targaryen's Queensguard\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Renly Baratheon's Kingsguard\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Daenerys Targaryen's Queensguard\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Behind the scenes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       In the books\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       See also\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       References and notes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Known past members\n   \n\n\n\n    Under\n    Aenys I Targaryen\n   \n\n\n\n    Ser\n    Serwyn Errol\n    , Lord Commander\n    \n\n      Ser {\n      Mychal Baratheon\n      }, killed by members of the\n      \n       Faith Militant\n      \n      during a\n      raid on the\n      \n       Red Keep\n      \n      .\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n    Under\n    Viserys I Targaryen\n   \n\n\n\n    Ser\n    Ryam Redwyne\n    , Lord Commander\n   \n\n    Ser\n    Criston Cole\n    , Lord Commander\n    \n\n      Ser\n      Arryk Cargyll\n      , twin brother of Ser Erryk\n     \n\n      Ser\n      Erryk Cargyll\n      , twin brother of Ser Arryk\n     \n\n      Ser Rickard Thorne\n     \n\n      Ser Lorent Marbrand, sided with\n      Rhaenyra Targaryen\n      and against\n      Aegon II Targaryen\n      during the Targaryen civil war known as the\n      \n       Dance of the Dragons\n      \n      .

In the case of a female sovereign (and thus a Queensguard rather than a Kingsguard), the title is\n   \n    Lord Commander of the Queensguard\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The king usually appoints a new Lord Commander from one of the current serving members of the Kingsguard, though there may have been exceptional cases in which a knight was instantly appointed to the Kingsguard as well as the position of Lord Commander.\n  \n\n   The Lord Commander wears the same uniform armor as the regular members of the Kingsguard, with no difference in appearance or regalia.  Given that there are only seven Kingsguard members at any one time, including the Lord Commander himself, it is usually an easy matter to keep track of their identities at court and on the battlefield.\n  \n\n   The position was founded, along with the Kingsguard itself, by\n   Aegon the Conqueror\n   , who\n   \n    united\n   \n   the Seven Kingdoms three hundred years before the\n   War of the Five Kings\n   .\n  \n\n   The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard also holds a seat on the king's\n   \n    small council\n   \n   by virtue of his office.

Theoretically a king might appoint one of the other six Kingsguard members as the new Lord Commander to replace him, but it is unknown if this has ever happened.\n  \n\n   While reading through the White Book, Jaime notes that most of the Kingsguard served adequately, but few people remember their names generations later. The only ones people remember centuries later are those who were the best (great heroes such as\n   Aemon the Dragonknight\n   ), and those who were the worst (either traitors to the crown or those who were derelict in their duty, broke their vows and fathered children). Jaime also notes that on rare occasion, some of the past Lord Commanders were a bit of both, particularly Ser Criston Cole, perhaps the most infamous Kingsguard member who ever lived until Jaime himself. He started out as a favorite of Princess\n   Rhaenyra Targaryen\n   , serving as Lord Commander of her father\n   Viserys I\n   's Kingsguard, but eventually had a falling out, and he joined her enemies at court. Conflicting stories from the banal to the lurid and extreme exist about exactly what happened between them, ranging from that Criston was too noble to break his vows of chastity, to that he eagerly offered to flee with her to the Free Cities as a common sellsword, but Rhaenyra thought that only a Kingsguard was worthy of her. Others say that it was actually Rhaenyra who threw herself at Criston, attempting to sexually seduce him and desperate to lose her virginity to him rather than in her arranged marriage to her homosexual cousin Laenor Velaryon - after which he grew disgusted and spurned her, and she took Harwin Strong as a new lover. Whatever the cause, Criston joined the rival faction at court championing her half-brother\n   Aegon II\n   , and upon the death of her father, was an active leader in the conspiracy, personally slitting the throat of the Master of Coin when he protested crowning Aegon II instead of Rhaenyra. Cole then personally placed the crown on Aegon II's head at his coronation, and was forever after remembered as \"the Kingmaker\". Some say that Cole supported Aegon II in the civil war that followed out of petty revenge against Rhaenyra, while some say he did it out of respect for Andal laws which place a son before a daughter in inheritance (despite the fact that her father had repeatedly and publicly made the high lords of the realm swear that Rhaenyra would rule after him). Still others say that Criston had no great love of Aegon II, yet was not driven out of petty hatred for Rhaenyra, but rather because he had honestly concluded that Rhaenyra was too unstable to rule (particularly due to her new husband Daemon Targaryen), and that the small council could more easily control Aegon II as a puppet ruler.\n  \n\n\n    Known Lords Commander\n   \n\n\n\n    Ser Corlys Velaryon, under\n    Aegon I Targaryen\n    .\n   \n\n    Ser Addison Hill, under Aegon I Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Gyles Morrigen, under Jaehaerys I Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Ryam Redwyne, under Jaehaerys I and Viserys I Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Harrold Westerling, under Viserys I Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Criston Cole, under Viserys I and Aegon II Targaryen\n   \n\n    Ser Willis Fell, under Aegon III Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Robin Massey, under Aegon III Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser\n    Marston Waters\n    , under Aegon III Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Raynard Ruskyn, under Aegon III Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Prince Aemon Targaryen, under Daeron I, Baelor, Viserys II, and Aegon IV Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Duncan the Tall, under Aegon V Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Gerold Hightower, under Aerys II Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Barristan Selmy, under Robert Baratheon and Joffrey Baratheon.\n   \n\n    Ser Jaime Lannister, under Joffrey and Tommen Baratheon.\n   \n\n\n\n    Unknown reign\n   \n\n\n\n    Ser Robert Flowers\n   \n\n    Ser Alyn Connington\n   \n\n    The Demon of Darry\n   \n\n\n\n    Lords Commander to rival claimants\n   \n\n\n\n    Ser Steffon Darklyn, under\n    Rhaenyra Targaryen\n    .\n   \n\n    Ser Lorent Marbrand, under Rhaenyra Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Glendon Goode, under Rhaenyra Targaryen.\n   \n\n    Ser Loras Tyrell, under Renly Baratheon.

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As",

Lord Frey has summoned every\n   \n    Frey\n   \n   who took part in the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   under the pretext of revealing his plans. Walder orders the servants to serve them wine from the\n   \n    Arbor\n   \n   but harshly tells his latest wife\n   Kitty Frey\n   that he is not wasting any wine on \"a damn woman\". Walder thanks his family for helping him to slaughter the\n   \n    Starks\n   \n   and backhandedly compliments his brood for the violent deaths of\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , his wife\n   \n    Talisa Stark\n   \n   , their unborn child, and Lady\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   , much to the nervous laughter of his family.\n  \n\n   However, when the Freys begin to choke from poisoned wine, Walder chides them for not killing all the Starks. Walder remarks, \"Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe,\" as his family members die around him. \"Walder\" then reveals himself as a disguised\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   , who has exacted vengeance on those who arranged the massacre of her mother and brother at the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   . Arya spares Walder's\n   wife\n   and the servants. She tells them, \"The North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\"\n  \n\n   Later, Arya, having acquired a horse, is riding south when she stumbles upon a group of\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   soldiers who have been sent to the Twins to keep law and order. The soldiers are singing \"Hands of Gold\" and offer to share rabbit meat for dinner. When the soldiers ask why she is riding south, Arya tells them that she is traveling to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Arya learns from the soldiers that the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   and its surroundings have been\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and that the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   has been essentially sealed. The young soldiers insist that she join them around the campfire to eat and rest. When she asks about their adventures, the soldiers admit that they are homesick and once they left home they wished to return to their families. The young soldier offers her blackberry wine while his brother in arms asks why she is traveling south. Arya tells them that she is going to kill\n   \n    the Queen\n   \n   . Thinking that she is joking, they all burst out laughing. Arya smiles and laughs with them.\n  \n\n   Elsewhere,\n   \n    Sandor Clegane\n   \n   is riding north with the\n   \n    Brotherhood Without Banners\n   \n   , through thick snow. They decide to take shelter for the night at an abandoned home but Sandor, recognizing the house, declares it unsafe.\n   \n    Beric Dondarrion\n   \n   dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter the house where they discover the corpses of the\n   Farmer\n   and his daughter\n   Sally\n   , whom he and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.\n  \n\n   Sandor recalls seeing Beric at the tournament at\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , and wonders aloud why Beric keeps getting resurrected, as there's nothing special about him. Beric confides that he does not know what\n   \n    R'hllor\n   \n   , the Lord of Light, is telling him. Sandor remarks that he does not believe in divine justice, citing the fate of the farmer and his daughter. Despite Sandor's fear of flames, Thoros tells him to look into the fire. He tells him that only the fire can show him what the Lord of Light wants him to see. At first, Sandor can only see burning logs, but then, to his own shock, he sees a\n   \n    Wall of Ice\n   \n   . He also sees a\n   \n    castle where the Wall meets the sea\n   \n   , a mountain that looks like an arrowhead, and thousands of the\n   \n    dead\n   \n   marching past. Beric asks Sandor if he now believes that they are here for a reason.\n  \n\n   Later,\n   \n    Thoros\n   \n   finds Sandor burying the dead farmer and his daughter Sally in the snow. Thoros deduces that Sandor knew the dead, but Sandor admits that he doesn't. The two of them bury the bodies together, and Sandor attempts to deliver an epitaph to\n   the Seven\n   , but can't remember the rest of the verse. Instead, he simply tells the dead that they deserve better.\n  \n\n\n    At Winterfell\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , the\n   \n    King in the North\n   \n\n    Jon Snow\n   \n   organizes the defense of the North against the Night King and his army of the dead. He asks that all maesters start searching for\n   \n    dragonglass\n   \n   , stressing it is now more valuable than gold due to its effectiveness against the White Walkers. Jon also requests that Tormund and his people man Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as Tormund and the other wildlings were present at Hardhome and have seen the Night King and Tormund agrees to defend this castle. Jon orders for all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 in his kingdom to be trained in combat in order to defend against the encroaching threat of the White Walkers. Because having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough, he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. When\n   Robett Glover\n   balks at the idea of arming his young granddaughter,\n   \n    Lady\n   \n\n    Lyanna Mormont\n   \n   remarks that she certainly will not remain idle and volunteers to help, giving her assurance that every girl on\n   \n    Bear Island\n   \n   will be trained alongside the boys. The words of the young lady once more remind the older lords of their place and they agree.\n  \n\n   The next order of business is the possibility of the Walkers getting past the wall; if they do, Jon notes that the first obstacles they encounter will be the castles of\n   \n    Last Hearth\n   \n   and\n   Karhold\n   , the seats belonging to the two Northern houses that fought alongside the Boltons. Lord\n   \n    Yohn Royce\n   \n   opines that the castles should be demolished for their lords' treachery, but\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   interjects that Last Hearth and Karhold committed no crimes and urges her half-brother to instead strip the\n   \n    Umbers\n   \n   and\n   \n    Karstarks\n   \n   of their castles as punishment for turning against the Starks. However, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and she reluctantly obliges. Jon then summons\n   Ned Umber\n   and\n   Alys Karstark\n   - both of whom are children who obviously played no part in their father's betrayal and are clearly terrified of what will happen to them. He asks them to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore.\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   watches the proceedings with a smile.\n  \n\n   In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies. He tells Sansa that while she is his sister and she can question his decisions, doing so when he is publicly addressing the Northern lords and ladies undermines his position with them. When Sansa responds that the late\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   did not tolerate dissent, Jon reassures her that h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Stormborn\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Season 7\n        \n\n         Episode 2\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Airdate\n     \n\n      July 23, 2017\n     \n\n\n\n      Runtime\n     \n\n      59 minutes\n     \n\n\n\n      Written by\n     \n\n\n       Bryan Cogman\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Directed by\n     \n\n      Mark Mylod\n     \n\n\n     Episode guide\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Previous\n        \n\n         Next\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         \"\n         \n          Dragonstone\n         \n         \"\n        \n\n         \"\n         \n          The Queen's Justice\n         \n         \"\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n   \"\n   \n    Stormborn\n   \n   \" is the second episode of the\n   \n    seventh season\n   \n   of\n   \n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   .

Varys informs Daenerys that Queen\n   \n    Cersei Lannister\n   \n   's position on\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   is tenuous. Tyrion counsels her not to burn the Seven Kingdoms and proposes that she forge alliances with the other Houses not currently aligned with Cersei. Dany then questions Varys about his previous services to her father the\n   \n    Mad King\n   \n   and\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   . Varys confides that King Robert Baratheon had little interest in ruling but initially appeared to be a definite improvement over Aerys II.\n  \n\n   Dany then confronts Varys about his role in hiring the assassins to target her; Varys reminds her that his choices were limited to either feigning continuing loyalty to Robert by arranging the assassination, or refusing and losing his head for it. She distrusts Varys due to his track record of switching allegiances. Refusing to be intimidated, Varys points out that incompetent rulers do not deserve blind loyalty, then recounts his lowly origins as a castrated slave and tells her that his true loyalty lies with the oppressed masses. Varys tells Daenerys that if all she wants from him is blind loyalty, she may as well have him killed, but he is much more useful to her and to the Realm alive, and that he believes she is the last hope for the people. Dany accepts his fealty on the condition that he not conspire against her - instead, she has Varys swear that if he thinks she is failing the people, he'll tell her when she's wrong and be as honest with her as he has been today. Varys agrees. Seemingly satisfied, Daenerys also warns Varys that if he betrays her, she will burn him alive. Varys replies that he would expect nothing less from the \"Mother of Dragons.\"\n  \n\n   Daenerys is then visited by the\n   \n    Red Priestess\n   \n\n    Melisandre\n   \n   , who believes that Dany might be\n   The Prince That Was Promised\n   . Varys questions Melisandre about her previous service to the ill-fated King\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   . While Daenerys initially does not believe that she could be the Prince,\n   \n    Missandei\n   \n   reveals that the\n   \n    High Valyrian\n   \n   word for \"prince\" or \"princess\" is gender neutral. When Daenerys asks Melisandre if she believes the prophecy applies to her, Melisandre replies she believes it could refer to Daenerys or one other:\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the\n   \n    King in the North\n   \n   , who has united the North and the\n   Wildlings\n   against\n   \n    a common enemy\n   \n   . Tyrion vouches for Jon Snow and convinces Daenerys that he will make a good ally, given the\n   \n    crimes\n   \n   committed by the Lannisters\n   \n    against his family\n   \n   . Dany accepts Tyrion's advice, and tells him to extend an invitation for Jon to attend her at Dragonstone – where Jon must \"bend the knee.\"\n  \n\n   In the\n   Chamber of the Painted Table\n   ,\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   and\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   firmly advocate an immediate assault on\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Tyrion advises against laying waste to the Kingdoms' capital and causing the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents. When Ellaria belittles Tyrion for his lack of stomach for war (despite his previous command and service at the Battle of the Blackwater), Tyrion retorts by deriding Ellaria in that her sole accomplishment to the war effort has been to poison an innocent girl, his niece\n   \n    Myrcella Baratheon\n   \n   , for the sake of petty vengeance against the Lannisters. Ellaria does not deny it and expresses regret that her lover\n   \n    Oberyn Martell\n   \n   died for the cause of Tyrion's freedom. Daenerys ends the argument with a rebuke for Ellaria to respect her\n   \n    Hand\n   \n   . Back to the matter of the invasion, Daenerys insists she doesn't wish to be known as the Queen of the Ashes, to which\n   \n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   sarcastically ponders if Daenerys will take the Iron Throne by asking politely. Olenna reminds Daenerys of her granddaughter\n   \n    Margaery Tyrell\n   \n   's fate, a beloved queen who was killed when Cersei\n   \n    blew up\n   \n   the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Tyrion proposes using a combination of Tyrell and Dornish forces to lay siege to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , much to the chagrin of Olenna and Ellaria, who balk at the thought of using their own soldiers. Tyrion, however, insists that using the\n   \n    Unsullied\n   \n   and\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   would arouse the patriotism of Westerosi bannermen, who would see them as foreign invaders and potentially close ranks behind Cersei. He proposes sending\n   \n    Grey Worm\n   \n   and the Unsullied to take\n   \n    Casterly Rock\n   \n   instead, cutting off Cersei's retreat and dealing a massive blow to the morale of the Western army. In the meantime, the Greyjoy fleet will escort Ellaria back to\n   \n    Sunspear\n   \n   to rally the Dornish forces and then ferry them up the coast to King's Landing, bypassing the\n   \n    Stormlands\n   \n   and allowing the siege to commence early. Daenerys accepts Tyrion's proposal and reminds the others on her council that she will not be attacking King's Landing, and requests consenting approval from everyone, which they give.\n  \n\n   Daenerys dismisses everyone except Lady Olenna. The Dragon Queen tells the Queen of Thorns she is aware that her motives are based on revenge for Cersei and not out of love for Daenerys. Daenerys insists that she will usher in an era of peace. Olenna, however, reflects that there was never a lasting peace under\n   \n    the Mad King\n   \n   , or any preceding\n   \n    Targaryen\n   \n   , for that matter. She tells Daenerys that Tyrion is a clever man but she herself has outlasted many clever men by not listening to their advice. Olenna says the lords of Westeros are sheep but Daenerys is not a sheep. She counsels Daenerys that if she's to rule Westeros, \"You're a dragon. Be a dragon.\"\n  \n\n   Later, Missandei visits Grey Worm to bid him farewell before his departure to Casterly Rock. Grey Worm confides that Missandei is his weakness, and when she expresses confusion, he tells her that the\n   Good Masters\n   of\n   \n    Astapor\n   \n   tortured the Unsullied by exposing them to their worst fears. For example, a fear of dogs led to being made to sleep with dogs, a fear of heights means climbing a cliff. If the young boy was afraid of drowning, he'd be thrown into the sea. If he drowns, it would be \"good\", and if he learns to swim, it would be \"good\" because only the fit survive. Grey Worm recalls that he was never the biggest/fastest/strongest but he was the most fearless warrior until he met Missandei. She replies that she also has to deal with fear and kisses him. Missandei strips naked and proceeds to undress Grey Worm. Grey Worm is reluctant to remove his trousers (presumably not wanting to horrify her with his castration scars) but eventually acquiesces to Missandei's wishes. The two of them then share an intimate sexual encounter.\n  \n\n\n    In King's Landing\n   \n\n\n   In the throne room of the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   , Queen Cersei Lannister gives a speech urging several nobles from the\n   \n    Reach\n   \n   , including Lord\n   \n    Randyll Tarly\n   \n   , to reaffirm the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     The Queen's Justice\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Season 7\n        \n\n         Episode 3\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Airdate\n     \n\n      July 30, 2017\n     \n\n\n\n      Runtime\n     \n\n      63 minutes\n     \n\n\n\n      Written by\n     \n\n\n       David Benioff\n      \n      &\n      \n       D.B.

The crowd pelt Yara, Ellaria, and Tyene with rotting fruit. Impressed with his \"gift\", Cersei agrees to an alliance with the Lord Reaper and praises him as a true friend to the Crown. Ellaria spits at Cersei's feet while Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   is present among the\n   \n    Queensguard\n   \n   . When Euron demands his \"reward\", Cersei responds that he will get it once the war is over. Cersei appoints Euron as the commander of her naval forces and her brother\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   as commander of her armies. Despite the fanfare, Jaime is privately hostile towards Euron and tells the\n   Lord Reaper of Pyke\n   that his head belongs on a spike. Euron tells Jaime that he desires Cersei and asks for tips about her sexual tastes, much to Jaime's silent fury.\n  \n\n   Later, Cersei confronts Ellaria and Tyene in their cell, where both are gagged and chained to opposite walls. Accompanied by Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   and\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   , Cersei remembers\n   \n    Oberyn Martell\n   \n   's showdown with Ser Gregor during Tyrion's\n   second trial by combat\n   , sadistically recalling the Red Viper's savage death to Ellaria and how Ellaria screamed at the sight of it. She later provokes Ellaria's sorrow by recalling Oberyn's fearsome skill with a spear, and how that eventually didn't stop Gregor from killing him, as well as inferring that Oberyn brought his death on himself by taunting Gregor instead of just leaving him to die. She then remembers raising\n   \n    Myrcella\n   \n   , and the fact that Ellaria murdered her.\n  \n\n   Cersei goes on to praise Tyene's beauty to Ellaria and suggesting that she is Ellaria's favorite. She contemplates how she will execute Ellaria or Tyene, cruelly suggesting Ser Gregor kill them the way he killed Oberyn. However, opining that it would be too fast a death, she kisses Tyene with the\n   Long Farewell\n   , citing poetic justice for Myrcella's murder, and torments Ellaria by having Qyburn confirm the uncertainty of\n   \n    when\n   \n   the girl will die, but also the inevitability of it, as the Long Farewell varies on how long it takes to kill, depending on the strength of its victim's constitution. Cersei tells Ellaria that she will be left alive to witness the event as well as to watch her daughter's \"beautiful face crumble into bone and dust\", and that she will be made to contemplate the things she has done, even to the point of being force-fed if she tries to starve herself to death. Before leaving, Cersei orders that torches be routinely replaced so that Ellaria doesn't miss a moment of Tyene's demise as Ellaria frantically struggles against her chains in a futile effort to reach her daughter.\n  \n\n   Later that evening, Jaime is drinking wine for supper when Cersei arrives and kisses him. He initially rebuffs her advances but ultimately consents to sex. The next morning, following an incestuous night with Jaime, Cersei answers the door for a\n   servant\n   who announces that a visitor from\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   has arrived. Cersei acknowledges the message and requests fresh sheets.\n  \n\n   Cersei meets with\n   Tycho Nestoris\n   , a representative from the\n   \n    Iron Bank of Braavos\n   \n   , who offers his condolences for the loss of her son\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   . Tycho thanks Cersei for eradicating the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , which he describes as superstition. Cersei realizes that the Iron Bank wants to bet on the strongest faction. Cersei tells Tycho that Lord Euron controls the sea and is an ally for the time being. Cersei convinces Nestoris to side with the\n   \n    Lannisters\n   \n   by denouncing Daenerys as a revolutionary rather than a monarch. She promises that the Lannisters will pay their debts unlike the Dothraki and former slaves. Cersei vows to pay the Crown's debts in full within a fortnight and invites Nestoris to stay in King's Landing. Nestoris is pleased and describes Cersei as her \"father's daughter\".\n  \n\n\n    At Winterfell\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , Sansa and\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   learn from\n   \n    Maester\n   \n   Wolkan\n   that they have about 4,000 bushels of wheat. Sansa realizes that they don't have enough food for the coming winter. She advocates building granaries to stockpile for a famine. Sansa also orders\n   \n    Yohn Royce\n   \n   to see that the armor made for their armies is outfitted with leather to keep warm. While walking, Baelish and Sansa talk about the threat of Cersei. Petyr urges her to fight every battle and to look for threats in every corner. They are then interrupted by a guard who tells Lady Stark that she has received a visitor, who turns out to be her younger brother\n   \n    Bran Stark\n   \n   , accompanied by\n   \n    Meera Reed\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Following a tearful reunion, the two siblings retreat to the\n   \n    Godswood\n   \n   , where Sansa tells Bran how she wishes Jon were there with them at Winterfell. Bran agrees, noting that he needs to speak to Jon. When Sansa points out that Bran is the rightful\n   \n    Lord of Winterfell\n   \n   since he is the last remaining true-born son of Ned Stark, he refuses the position, stating that he is the\n   \n    Three-Eyed Raven\n   \n   and thus can't be any sort of Lord. Sansa begs for Bran to explain what that means, and Bran then demonstrates his newly-acquired power to a skeptical Sansa by recalling details from the night of her marriage to\n   \n    Ramsay Bolton\n   \n   . Startled, Sansa walks away in shock and tears.\n  \n\n\n    In Oldtown\n   \n\n\n   At the\n   \n    Citadel\n   \n   ,\n   Archmaester\n   Ebrose\n   examines\n   \n    Jorah Mormont\n   \n   's wounds and surmises that the\n   \n    infection\n   \n   is no longer active. Ebrose realizes that somebody treated Jorah, but Mormont claims the belief that rest and the climate healed him. Ebrose lets Jorah go but orders a private audience with\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   later that evening; it's obvious to Jorah and Sam that he's in trouble, but Sam says he'll find out by just how much in the evening. Jorah tells Sam that he is returning to Daenerys because she gave him hope and a sense of purpose. Jorah thanks Sam for saving him, and Sam says it's the least he could do given everything that\n   \n    Jeor Mormont\n   \n   did for him. Jorah is clearly moved when he takes Sam's offered farewell handshake, having expected to never touch another person ever again.\n  \n\n   In private, Ebrose chastises Sam for embarking on an illegal healing procedure due to the high risk of infection. Nevertheless, he praises Sam for his success, noting that it was an extraordinarily difficult operation, and asks for the secret of his success. Sam replies that he simply read the books and followed the instructions. Ebrose \"congratulates\" Sam by telling him to make fresh copies of several old manuscripts and scrolls so their knowledge can be preserved, explaining that Sam's reward is not being expelled from the Citadel.\n  \n\n\n    On Dragonstone\n   \n\n\n\n    Jon\n   \n   and\n   \n    Davos\n   \n   arrive at\n   \n    Dragonstone\n   \n   , and are immediately greeted by\n   \n    Tyrion\n   \n   and\n   \n    Missandei\n   \n   . Upon meeting, Tyrion addresses Jon as the\n   \n    bastard\n   \n   of\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , while Jon addresses him as the dwarf of\n   \n    Casterly Rock\n   \n   – the two share a friendly grin.

    "question": "What is Game of Thrones armor made of?",
    "response": "In the Game of Thrones universe, armor is depicted as being made from a variety of materials, drawing inspiration from real-world medieval designs to enhance the show's realism and storytelling. Here's a breakdown based on the series' portrayal:\n\n- **Steel and Iron**: Most heavy armor, such as plate armor worn by knights and soldiers (e.g., the Lannister forces or the Kingsguard), is made from steel or iron. This includes breastplates, helmets, and gauntlets, which are forged to provide strong protection in battles. For instance, the Iron Throne itself is described as being made from melted swords, implying similar metalworking techniques for armor.\n\n- **Chainmail**: This is a common material for flexible protection, consisting of interlinked rings of metal (often steel or iron). Characters like those in the Night's Watch or Dothraki warriors use chainmail undercoats for mobility while defending against slashes and arrows.\n\n- **Leather**: Lighter and more practical for scouts or less armored fighters, leather armor is used for padding, jerkins, or full suits. It's often treated for durability, as seen with the Wildlings or rangers beyond the Wall. Leather is combined with metal reinforcements for added strength.\n\n- **Other Elements**: Some armor incorporates exotic materials like dragonscale (in later seasons) or boiled leather for waterproofing, but these are less common. The construction typically involves riveting, forging, and layering for both functionality and aesthetic representation of each house or culture.\n\nThis variety reflects the show's attention to detail, influenced by historical armor from periods like the Middle Ages. If you're interested in practical applications, such as cosplay or fan art, real props are often made from safer materials like plastic, foam, or faux leather to mimic these designs. For more specifics, I recommend checking official sources like the Game of Thrones wiki or behind-the-scenes features.",

The Iron Throne was also a metonym referring to the monarchy that rules the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   and the authority of the monarchy (e.g. \"rebellion against the Iron Throne\").\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       History\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Background\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Season 1\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Season 2\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Season 3\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Season 4\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.6\n        \n\n         Season 6\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.7\n        \n\n         Season 7\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.8\n        \n\n         Season 8\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       In the books\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Behind the scenes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       See also\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    History\n   \n\n\n\n    Background\n   \n\n\n   The Iron Throne was forged at the order of\n   \n    Aegon the Conqueror\n   \n   , the first of the\n   \n    Targaryen\n   \n\n    Kings\n   \n   , who\n   \n    conquered six of the seven\n   \n   independent kingdoms of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   and unified them under his rule - the seventh kingdom of\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   was later joined through a marriage alliance. The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide.

However, the reign of\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   , nicknamed the Mad King for his insanity and cruelty, was challenged in the form of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   . Ultimately, the rebellion saw a rebel victory with Prince Rhaegar's death at the\n   \n    Battle of the Trident\n   \n   and the Mad King's death during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   ; only the young Prince\n   \n    Viserys\n   \n   and newborn Princess\n   \n    Daenerys\n   \n   survived due to their smuggling across the\n   \n    Narrow Sea\n   \n   to the\n   \n    Free Cities\n   \n   of\n   \n    Essos\n   \n   by loyalists. Robert was crowned king.\n  \n\n   Robert's death\n   threw the realm into chaos as civil war erupted in the form of the massive\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   . Robert's two brothers,\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   and\n   \n    Renly Baratheon\n   \n   , laid claim to the Iron Throne on the basis that\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   's children were bastards born of incest with her brother\n   \n    Jaime\n   \n   .

Apparently hoping to exploit disunity among the Stark children, he tries to ingratiate himself with Bran,\n   \n    Ned Stark\n   \n   's last trueborn son and rightful heir to Winterfell. Littlefinger gives Bran a gift, the very same\n   Valyrian steel dagger\n   that a\n   cutthroat\n   tried to kill him with while he was in a coma right after he was pushed from one of Winterfell's towers. Bran is still emotionally detached, however, from all of his\n   \n    visions\n   \n   as the new\n   \n    Three-Eyed Raven\n   \n   , and is generally uninterested, only absentmindedly asking who the dagger belonged to. With a wry look, Littlefinger responds that, in a way, this is the question which started the entire\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   . Bran's mother\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   took the dagger south with her to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   to try to find who it belonged to, convinced the Lannisters sent the cutthroat to kill Bran (and left it there in Ned's possession, from whom Littlefinger recovered it). Littlefinger tries to manipulate Bran by remarking on how much chaos he must have lived through to get back to Winterfell. In response, Bran looks at Littlefinger and says, \"Chaos is a ladder,\" quoting back Littlefinger's own words to him, which Littlefinger said to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   in King's Landing years before and which Bran couldn't possibly have been physically present to hear himself. Visibly unnerved, Littlefinger is startled by\n   \n    Meera Reed\n   \n   entering the room. He takes his leave of Bran, calling him \"Lord Stark\", though again Bran insists he's not a Lord.\n  \n\n   After Littlefinger leaves, Meera notices Bran's new wheelchair. He explains Maester\n   Wolkan\n   built it for him. She tells him that she has come to tell him she's leaving and say goodbye; she promised to keep him safe, and now that he's back in Winterfell surrounded by his Stark forces, he's as safe as anyone will be before the coming war. Meera explains that when the White Walkers arrive, she wants to be with her family, so she is heading back to the\n   \n    Neck\n   \n   to assist the\n   Crannogmen\n   . She says he doesn't need her in Winterfell anymore; Bran agrees with her and with blank emotional affect, simply thanking her for her help. Meera becomes angry that this is all he has to say after everything they went through, when\n   \n    Hodor\n   \n   and\n   \n    Summer\n   \n   and even her own brother\n   \n    Jojen\n   \n   died for Bran. Bran responds that he isn't really \"Bran Stark\" anymore, but the Three-Eyed Raven. He \"remembers\" the events of Bran Stark's life, but now \"remembers\" vast amounts of other accumulated memories from centuries upon centuries. Everything that once affected \"Bran Stark\" now seems distant and trivial to him. In horror, Meera cries that he \"died\" in the cave and leaves.\n  \n\n   Meanwhile,\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   finally returns to Winterfell, after leaving years before with her father, Sansa, and King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   's entourage, right after Bran's fall from the tower. Arya rides up to the gates and dismounts, but the guards don't believe her when she says she is in fact Arya Stark, convinced that Arya has been dead for years. Arya asks that they send word to Maester\n   \n    Luwin\n   \n   and\n   \n    Rodrik Cassel\n   \n   , hoping either can prove her identity but unaware they are both dead. The guards gruffly say that no one by those names is there, so Arya asks for Jon. The two say he'd just left Winterfell. Arya asks who is in charge of Winterfell then, and they say \"Lady Stark\" (who Arya realizes is\n   \n    her sister\n   \n   ). They try to brush her aside, but she dodges them with her assassin's reflexes, and insists that one way or another, she's getting in. She explains to them that if she is Arya, they'll be in a lot of trouble for turning her away, and if she isn't, she won't last long in Winterfell anyway. Mildly concerned, they agree to at least let her in the courtyard but insist that she stay put while they consult Sansa so they can disprove her identity. As soon as they take their eyes off her, however, she slips away. The two guards go to inform Sansa and try to wave it aside as just some impostor, but when they mention she asked for Luwin and Cassel, she instantly realizes it must be Arya, and already knows where she has gone.\n  \n\n   Sansa finds Arya where she expected, in the crypts looking over their father Ned's grave. They are happy to see each other but so much has happened to both of them in the past few years that they are at first awkward, unsure of what to say. Arya asks if she has to call Sansa \"Lady Stark\" now, to which Sansa firmly insists yes, and laughs. They smile and hug, though still a bit unsure. Arya notes that Jon left her in charge and smiles when Sansa says that she hopes Jon will be back soon. He will be both surprised and happy to see Arya, Sansa remembering how happy Jon was to see her when they were reunited. The sisters then look sadly on their father's grave statue. Arya says it doesn't really look like him. Sansa acknowledges that everyone who knew his face well is dead. Arya points out they're not.\n  \n\n   Arya then asks if Sansa killed Joffrey as everyone believes. She explains she actually didn't, though she wished she had. Arya remarks that he was always at the top of her \"list\". This confuses Sansa, and Arya explains that she'd been keeping a list of everyone she was going to kill, at which they both laugh. Finally, Sansa asks how Arya got back, but she only says her road wasn't a pleasant one. Sansa says hers wasn't either. They hug again, earnestly and warmly. Sansa then informs Arya that Bran is home too. Arya is elated, but her face falls when Sansa makes no mention of\n   \n    Rickon\n   \n   , immediately realizing that Rickon is dead.\n  \n\n   Sansa brings Arya to Bran in the\n   \n    Godswood\n   \n   , where he is lost in thought by the\n   \n    Weirwood\n   \n   heart tree\n   . Arya is saddened to see him so paralyzed. Still somewhat detached even at the sight of Arya, he says he isn't surprised she's alive because he\n   \n    saw\n   \n   her at the\n   \n    Crossroads\n   \n   . Arya is confused, and Sansa explains that Bran is having \"\n   visions\n   \" now. Bran says he thought Arya was going to King's Landing, and when Sansa asks why she would head there of all places, he again startles them both by saying it's because Cersei is on her list of names (which he can't possibly be aware of through normal means). Sansa asks who else is on her list, but she says most of them besides Cersei are actually dead already.\n  \n\n   They then remark on the\n   Valyrian steel dagger\n   in his lap, and he explains that Littlefinger gave it to him, thinking he'd want it. Despite it being such a horrible keepsake that nearly killed him\n   \n    and\n   \n   indirectly set off a chain of events leading to his parents' deaths, he is still listless and disinterested in it. Arya is confused as to why a\n   common cutthroat\n   would have a rare, priceless blade of\n   \n    Valyrian steel\n   \n   . Bran matter-of-factly says that someone very wealthy wanted him dead, and gave it to the assassin. Sansa acknowledges she doesn't actually trust Littlefinger and he'd never give anyone anything unless expecting something in return.\n  \n\n   Bran says that doesn't matter, because he doesn't even want it. Instead, Bran hands it to Arya and says she can have it, saying the dagger would be \"wasted on a cripple\". Arya slowly takes the dagger and looks at it.\n  \n\n   Sansa, Bran, and Arya - the three remaining trueborn Stark children - proceed back to Winterfell's castle courtyard",

Another forthcoming Dunk & Egg story which he has fairly well planned out is called\n   \n    The Village Hero\n   \n   and takes place in the Riverlands.\n   Others he intends to write include\n   \n    The Sellsword\n   \n   ,\n   \n    The Champion\n   \n   ,\n   \n    The Kingsguard\n   \n   , and\n   \n    The Lord Commander\n   \n   , along with several as-yet untitled story ideas.\n  \n\n   There are at least nine more, unpublished novellas that Martin tentatively intends to write, for a total of twelve novellas once the entire series is finished.\n  \n\n\n    The Dance of the Dragons prequel novellas\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Princess and the Queen\n    \n    (2013)\n   \n\n\n     The Rogue Prince\n    \n    (2014)\n   \n\n\n   Martin began writing a detailed in-universe history text about the great Targaryen civil war known as the\n   \n    Dance of the Dragons\n   \n   (in which Targaryen fought Targaryen and dragon fought dragon) as a submission for an omnibus of collected works by several authors. In his own words he got a bit carried away, and ended up writing a detailed 80,000 word history even though the maximum length set for the novella submission was 30,000 pages. Martin had to focus only on one 30,000 work piece of the larger story, which he submitted as\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   (2013). This was later followed by\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   (2014), which is about 10,000 words long. Therefore, as of 2015 about half of what he wrote has not been released.\n  \n\n   The narrative conceit that Martin developed for these prequels is a drastic departure from his previous third person POV writing style. Instead, it is presented as an in-universe history text from Westeros written by \"Archmaester Gyldayn\". This format allowed Martin to write about events which were\n   \n    public\n   \n   knowledge to most people in Westeros, while still keeping the secret reasons why people actually did things unknown, or allowing secret betrayals to remain secret. To explain why only a 30,000 page section of the full 80,000 word text Martin wrote was not released, he gave the in-universe explanation that Gyldayn's history text was severely damaged and certain volumes lost, but that new sections are released as soon as the\n   \n    Citadel\n   \n   can locate copies of the missing sections.\n  \n\n   As a result,\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   takes place immediately before\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   , but it isn't really a true \"prequel\" because they were both written at the same time. Rather, it is as if the original draft was divided up into eight parts, of which\n   \n    The Princess and the Queen\n   \n   is \"part two through part four\" and\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   is \"part one\", but the parts were then released out of order. A reader can actually start with\n   \n    The Rogue Prince\n   \n   , out of publication order, without being spoiled for later events, because this is the order the material was actually originally intended to be read in.\n  \n\n\n    Companion books\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Art of Ice and Fire, Volume I\n    \n    (2005).\n   \n\n\n     The Art of Ice and Fire, Volume II\n    \n    (2011).\n   \n\n\n     A Feast of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2012) - a companion cooking book, with a forward by Martin.\n   \n\n\n     The Lands of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2012) - a collection of map-posters, including exclusive maps previously unreleased with the novels, and the first full map of the known world.\n   \n\n\n     The World of Ice and Fire\n    \n    (2014) - a sourcebook containing extensive amounts of previously unreleased information about Westeros, Essos, and other lands. Presented as an in-universe history book, giving a broad overview of the entire world.\n   \n\n\n\n      Fire & Blood\n     \n\n    (2018) - another in-universe history book: while the\n    \n     World\n    \n    book broadly covers everything from the North and the Reach to the Free Cities,\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    is focused in more detail on the three century reign of the Targaryen dynasty up to\n    \n     Aegon III\n    \n    . It is meant to be based on all of Martin's previously unpublished notes about the backstory of House Targaryen. The upcoming prequel series\n    \n\n      House of the Dragon\n     \n\n    is based on this book, specifically the events of the Dance of the Dragons.\n   \n\n\n     Fire & Blood, Volume Two\n    \n    (forthcoming) - a continuation of\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    up to the reign of\n    \n     Aerys II Targaryen\n    \n    , the \"Mad King.\" Martin revealed in July 2017 that\n    \n     Fire & Blood\n    \n    would have a second volume due to the size it had grown too, but that he won't continue with it until after the main novels are finished\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The World of Ice & Fire\n    \n\n\n\n\n    The World of Ice & Fire\n   \n   was published in 2014, presented as being an in-universe history book. It presents the expansive backstory of the\n   \n    known world\n   \n   of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   and beyond, much of it never revealed before in the main novels. It has not yet been mentioned within the main novel series, though it is considered to be fully part of the book-continuity canon.\n  \n\n   It was produced as an extensive collaboration between Martin himself and his long-time collaborators/fact-checkers, Elio Garcia and Linda Antonsson, who run the fansite Westeros.org. The project lasted nearly ten years: originally it was intended that Elio & Linda would write most of it as a summation of what was already mentioned in the novels, with Martin writing a few sidebars, but ultimately he produced vast new amounts of material both about the past of Westeros, and about the lands beyond it (actually expanding to detail the histories of lands\n   \n    east\n   \n   of the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   such as\n   \n    Yi Ti\n   \n   , which are barely even mentioned in the main novels).\n  \n\n   Originally the authors found it difficult to simply present an objective compendium/encyclopedia of events, because it would give away major revelations: would an article on\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   actually state that he isn't Ned Stark's son, but\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   's? Would an article about\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   explain why he\n   \n    really\n   \n   killed the Mad King, even though that is a secret revelation only given in the third novel? The answer they came up with was to present it as an in-universe history textbook written by \"Maester Yandel\". Yandel is the author-avatar of Elio & Linda, but at times he quotes from an earlier and more expansive history textbook written by \"Maester Gyldayn\" (the author avatar of George R.R. Martin). Thus the book isn't objective, but represents what is common knowledge to the average and reasonably well-informed lord in Westeros - i.e. most people actually know the general events of the\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   but in the core novels they don't halt the narrative for a dozen pages to give a long speech detailing everything about it. Similarly, most people in real life know the general outline of World War II, but characters in television and movies don't stop to give long speeches outlining the entire event, because they and everyone around them already knows it.\n  \n\n   Martin actually wrote a much longer history of\n   \n    House Targaryen\n   \n   which had to be edited down for the excerpts in\n   \n    The World of Ice & Fire\n   \n   - which were eventually collected into a volume called\n   \n    Fire & Blood\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Spin-offs\n   \n\n\n\n    Board \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     George R.R.

His parents were Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin, who also had two daughters, George's sisters Darleen and Janet. The family was of mixed Irish and Italian heritage. Raymond worked as a longshoreman, and the family lived in a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks. The family followed Roman Catholicism, and at the age of 13 George received the confirmation name \"Richard\", hence \"George Raymond Richard Martin\" (in later years, when working on the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series, George has described himself as a \"\n   lapsed Catholic\n   \").\n  \n\n   He became an avid fan of comic books while in high school:\n   \n    Fantastic Four\n   \n   #20 (November 1963) contains a letter he wrote to the editor. He subsequently became involved in the comic book fanzine scene, and attended the very first Comi-Con convention in New York City. In his youth he also became a fan of science fiction and fantasy literature, such as the works of Robert Heinlein, Robert E. Howard, Jack Vance and J.R.R. Tolkien. After college he held jobs as a journalist, chess tournament organizer and English teacher at a Christian women's college. He was married briefly in the mid-1970s, and has lived with his partner Parris in Santa Fe since 1981. They married in January 2011.\n  \n\n   Martin has chosen a turtle as his personal sigil, and he is often seen wearing a hat with a turtle pin on it. As Martin himself explained at the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   panel for San Diego Comic Con 2012:\n  \n\n   As he also explained in an interview with\n   \n    Financial Times\n   \n   :\n  \n\n\n    Short fiction\n   \n\n\n   Martin began writing his first short fiction in the late 1960s, but wasn't published professionally until 1971. A lot of Martin's early work was set in the 'Thousand Worlds', an SF backdrop set millennia into the future where humanity has slowly spread into space and encountered other races. His 1973 story from this setting,\n   \n    A Song for Lya\n   \n   , won Martin his first Hugo Award. In 1980 he achieved significant acclaim when\n   \n    Sandkings\n   \n   won both the Hugo and the Nebula for Best Novelette and\n   \n    The Way of Cross and Dragon\n   \n   won the Hugo for Best Short Story.\n   \n    Sandkings\n   \n   was for many years his best-known story and was adapted for television as the pilot episode of the new\n   \n    Outer Limits\n   \n   in 1996.\n  \n\n\n    Novels\n   \n\n\n   Martin moved into novel-length fiction with\n   \n    Dying of the Light\n   \n   , a sci-fi novel set in the Thousand Worlds milieu. It was published in 1977 and was nominated for a Hugo the following year. He followed up on this book with\n   \n    Windhaven\n   \n   in 1981, co-written with Lisa Tuttle. In 1982 he achieved significant critical and commercial success with\n   \n    Fevre Dream\n   \n   , a vampire novel set on the Mississippi around the time of the American Civil War which was nominated for the World Fantasy Award. His publishers eagerly signed up his follow-up,\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   , about a rock band whose comeback tour has supernatural overtones, but the book was a commercial failure, despite critical acclaim and a second World Fantasy Award nomination. Although Martin successfully sold a collection of his Thousand World stories featuring the character of Haviland Tuf as\n   \n    Tuf Voyaging\n   \n   , his novel career seemed to have stalled at that point.\n  \n\n\n    Hollywood\n   \n\n\n   The failure of\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   had a significant impact on Martin's fortunes, and there was little excitement over his next novel-in-progress,\n   \n    Black and White and Red All Over\n   \n   . However, television producer Phil DeGuere was impressed enough by\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   to option it as a movie script, and in 1985 asked Martin to contribute to a new project he was developing for CBS,\n   \n    The New Twilight Zone\n   \n   . Martin, although a huge fan of the original Rod Serling series, was hesitant to enter the competitive field of scriptwriting, but was convinced by the involvement of another writer he respected enormously, Harlan Ellison, as well as DeGuere's promise of backstage passes to Grateful Dead concerts. When Ellison abruptly left the series due to creative clashes, Martin was brought in as a staff writer. When the show unexpectedly returned for a second season, Martin was bumped up to story editor, but the series was then taken off the air for \"retooling\" for its third season.\n  \n\n   George R.R. Martin was not involved in the third season as Ron Koslow, a fan of his\n   \n    Twilight Zone\n   \n   work, had recruited him to be involved in his new urban fantasy series,\n   \n    Beauty and the Beast\n   \n   , starring Linda Hamilton, Ron Perlman and\n   Roy Dotrice\n   . Martin started as Executive Story Consultant and ended up as Supervising Producer on the third and final season. During his time on the show, he gained a reputation for being unafraid to kill off major characters (to fan's ire) and for showing the darker side of humanity. After the show ended, Martin had gained enough Hollywood credentials to attempt to launch his own show,\n   \n    Doorways\n   \n   , which eventually had a pilot produced by ABC in 1992. The pilot was never screened and the show never made, although a later series,\n   \n    Sliders\n   \n   , explored similar ideas.\n  \n\n\n    Roleplaying and\n    \n     Wild Cards\n    \n\n\n\n   Martin's first involvement with roleplaying games came when Scottish science fiction and fantasy writer Charles Stross 'borrowed' the githzerai and githyanki from his Thousand Worlds setting to use as\n   \n    Dungeons and Dragons\n   \n   monsters in an article for\n   \n    Dragon Magazine\n   \n   . They proved popular and have remained a D&D mainstay ever since, although Martin was unaware of the homage until many years later.\n  \n\n   Martin himself was introduced to roleplaying games in the late 1970s by Parris. His first game was\n   \n    Call of Cthulhu\n   \n   by Chaosium, and he was soon running his own game. However, he put this to one side when he was introduced to\n   \n    SuperWorlds\n   \n   by Victor Milán. His gaming group became enamored of the game and setting, and Martin eventually hit on the idea of developing their campaign into a shared-world anthology series. This idea proved successful, since such anthology series were all the rage in the mid-1980s thanks to the success of Lynn Abbey and Robert Asprin's\n   \n    Thieves World\n   \n   series, and Martin further enhanced the book by calling in experienced writers such as Roger Zelazny and Howard Waldrop to help expand it.\n   \n    Wild Cards\n   \n   was released in 1986 and was an immediate hit, and was succeeded by fourteen further books in the series, released over the next nine years. Despite very strong sales to start with, by the mid-1990s interest was  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           SPOILER WARNING\n          \n\n\n\n\n        This article includes content relating to the Dance of the Dragons, and therefore contains\n        \n         potential\n        \n        spoilers for\n        \n\n\n           House of the Dragon\n          \n\n\n        , as revealed in GRRM's writings.

The\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   are at war, with the\n   \n\n     King in the North\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , fighting to win independence for his people and those of the\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   . Robb decides that he must win the allegiance of the fiercely independent\n   \n    ironborn\n   \n   to his cause, and sends his best friend\n   \n    Theon Greyjoy\n   \n   to treat with\n   \n    his father\n   \n   , who is hatching plans of his own. Meanwhile,\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   holds the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   with the backing of the powerful\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   , but his uncle\n   \n    Renly\n   \n   has also claimed the throne with the support of\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   , whose armies are much larger. As they struggle for the throne,\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   arrives in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   to take matters in hand, only to face opposition from his scheming sister,\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   , now the Queen Regent.\n  \n\n   However, there is another faction entering the picture.\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   , Robert's younger brother and Renly's older brother, has also claimed the Iron Throne. A proven battle commander and veteran of\n   \n    several\n   \n\n    wars\n   \n   , Stannis is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies and will do what is right even if it destroys him. Advising him is\n   \n    Melisandre\n   \n   , an enigmatic\n   \n    priestess\n   \n   from the east, who believes Stannis is meant for a\n   greater destiny\n   , and Ser\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   , an honest and honorable man uneasy with the shifts in power at Stannis' court.\n  \n\n   Far to the east,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   has hatched the only three\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   in the world. Eventually they will grow into terrifying monsters capable of destroying cities at her command, but for now they are still hatchlings and vulnerable. With her\n   \n\n     khalasar\n    \n\n   gone, Daenerys and her small band of followers must find a way across a\n   \n    forbidding wasteland\n   \n   and find new allies to support her claim to the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   In the distant north, the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   has mounted an expedition beyond the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   , searching for missing rangers and investigating rumors of\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   gathering in the mountains. For\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   this will be a rite of passage as he is asked to make difficult choices, for the realm and for himself.\n  \n\n\n    Production\n   \n\n\n   Filming of Season 2 again took place in\n   Northern Ireland\n   , on location and at the Paint Hall studio facility in\n   Belfast\n   . Additional filming, for the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   storyline, took place in\n   Iceland\n   .\n   Malta\n   was not used for filming in Season 2, with the city of\n   Dubrovnik\n   in\n   Croatia\n   standing in for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   instead and used for the new location of\n   \n    Qarth\n   \n   .\n   The production considered filming in\n   Spain\n   but ultimately

The action begins in the unified\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   as the long summer ends and winter draws near. Lord\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   is asked by his old friend, King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , to serve as the\n   \n    Hand of the King\n   \n   following the death of the previous incumbent, Eddard's mentor\n   \n    Jon Arryn\n   \n   . Eddard is reluctant but receives intelligence suggesting that Jon was murdered. Eddard accepts Robert's offer, planning to use his position and authority to investigate the alleged murder.\n  \n\n   Meanwhile, on the eastern continent of\n   \n    Essos\n   \n   , the exiled children of\n   \n    House Targaryen\n   \n   , which Robert destroyed to claim the throne, are plotting to return to Westeros and unseat the 'usurper'. To this end,\n   \n    Viserys Targaryen\n   \n   arranges the marriage of his sister\n   \n    Daenerys\n   \n   to\n   \n    Khal\n   \n\n    Drogo\n   \n   , the leader of 40,000\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   warriors, in return for the use of his warriors in invading Westeros. For her part, Daenerys just wants to find a safe refuge far away from King Robert's assassins and her brother's scheming ambition.\n  \n\n   Finally, on the northern-most border of the Seven Kingdoms the sworn brothers of the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   guard the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   , a 300-mile-long colossal fortification of ice which has stood for thousands of years. The Watch defends the Wall against the depredations of the lawless\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   who live beyond, but rumor speaks of a\n   \n    new threat\n   \n   arising in the lands of perpetual winter.\n  \n\n\n    Production\n   \n\n\n   Season 1 was mainly filmed on location in\n   Northern Ireland\n   and\n   Malta\n   , with the Paint Hall facility in\n   Belfast\n   being used as the

Autumn has fallen across the world, with winter not far behind. The people should be preparing for years of snow and ice, but the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   instead remain gripped by\n   \n    civil war\n   \n   . Would-be king\n   \n    Renly Baratheon\n   \n   has been\n   assassinated\n   , altering the alliances in the war. The cruel boy-king\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   has won a great victory by securing an alliance with\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   , with his supporters defeating his uncle\n   \n    Stannis\n   \n   in an\n   \n    epic battle\n   \n   . Joffrey now commands the largest armies in the realm and his triumph appears inevitable.\n  \n\n   King\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   remains in the field, however his homeland, the\n   \n    North\n   \n   , is partially under\n   \n    ironborn\n   \n   occupation. Robb needs to decide on a course of action to win an overall victory. He must also win back the allegiance of\n   \n    House Frey\n   \n   , whom he has offended by breaking his marriage pact with them. King Robb has won every battle he has fought, but as with old King\n   \n    Robert\n   \n   , the Starks will have to see if good soldiers make good kings.\n  \n\n   Stannis Baratheon may be defeated and most of his army destroyed or scattered, but he is not out of the fight yet. Having retreated to his headquarters on\n   \n    Dragonstone\n   \n   island with his handful of surviving soldiers, Stannis' status as the last legitimate heir to his older brother Robert still casts a shadow over Joffrey's claim to the throne. With the\n   \n    priestess\n   \n\n    Melisandre\n   \n   at his side, Stannis can still influence the course of the war by striking where least expected.\n  \n\n   The lives of many others still hang in the balance.\n   \n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and his protectors must cross the frozen wastelands of the North to reach the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   , while\n   \n    Arya\n   \n   must brave the war-torn\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   in search of her mother and brother.\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   also has the thankless task of escorting the captive\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   home across hundreds of miles of battlefields and carnage.\n   \n    Theon Greyjoy\n   \n   must face the consequences of his actions at\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   . And in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   both\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   and\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   must brave the currents of a much more dangerous court in order to survive.\n  \n\n   On the\n   \n    eastern continent\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   has fled the political viper-pit of\n   \n    Qarth\n   \n   . Her\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   are growing and her fame is spreading, but to take the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   she will need supporters and an army. Both may be found in the corrupt cities of\n   \n    Slaver's Bay\n   \n   ... for a price.\n  \n\n\n    Beyond the Wall\n   \n   , the\n   \n    White Walkers\n   \n   are on the move, threatening both the Seven Kingdoms and the lands of the\n   \n    Free Folk\n   \n   . While the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   faces the threat of the White Walkers in the field,\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   must infiltrate the wildling army of\n   \n    Mance Rayder\n   \n   and discover the\n   \n    King-Beyond-the-Wall\n   \n   's plans.\n  \n\n\n    Production\n   \n\n\n   The series again filmed primarily in Northern Ireland,\n   and also returned to Iceland and Croatia.\n   The production also added Morocco to the locations roster.\n   The production expanded to three production units, adding a new \"Raven\" unit to the existing \"Dragon\" and \"Wolf\" units.\n  \n\n   Production in Croatia continued to use the walled medieval city of Dubrovnik to film external scenes for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , and Iceland was again used to film scenes set in the frozen lands that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   encounter\n   \n    Beyond the Wall\n   \n   . Production in the new location of Morocco filmed\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   's new storyline in\n   \n    Slaver's Bay\n   \n   as well as some King's Landing exterior shots.\n  \n\n   The scene from the episode \"\n   \n    The Bear and the Maiden Fair\n   \n   \" during which Brienne of Tarth is thrown into a bear pit at\n   \n    Harrenhal\n   \n   involved a real trained stunt bear,\n   Bart the Bear\n   . Due to are various legal restrictions on international transport of large animals such as bears, parts of this scene were\n   \n    technically\n   \n   filmed in Los Angeles in the United States.\n   A duplicate of the bear pit set was created in a Los Angeles studio parking lot: only Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) were brought in to film, with no extras. Both actually did film with the bear in the set.\n  \n\n   Filming in Season 1 included locations in Northern Ireland and Malta, but filming did not return to Malta in subsequent seasons. The Targaryen storyline in\n   \n    Pentos\n   \n   was filmed in the Maltese presidential palace (as well as a few other scenes for King's Landing). Maltese officials were reportedly annoyed that a nude scene was filmed in the palace (Daenerys's bath in the first episode), which may have influenced why production did not return to that country.\n  \n\n   Season 2 expanded to film in Croatia and Iceland, and filming continued in those two countries through Season 3 and Season 4. In Season 3 production expanded to Morocco, but did not return to Morocco for Season 4.\n  \n\n   The result is that the production on Season 3 was a monumental, international effort involving units and cast members which were filming\n   \n    simultaneously\n   \n   in four separate countries. The series has filmed in five countries overall, but filming in Malta ended before production expanded to the other three countries. This number increases to six if one counts the footage of the actor-bear used in Season 3. Because filming did not return to Morocco in Season 4, this makes Season 3 the most widespread international filming project that the TV series has engaged in to date.\n  \n\n\n    Cast\n   \n\n\n\n    Starring cast\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Peter Dinklage\n    \n    as\n    \n     Tyrion Lannister\n    \n\n     (9 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Nikolaj Coster-Waldau\n    \n    as\n    \n     Jaime Lannister\n    \n\n     (7 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Lena Headey\n    \n    as\n    \n     Cersei Lannister\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Emilia Clarke\n    \n    as\n    \n     Daenerys Targaryen\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Kit Harington\n    \n    as\n    \n     Jon Snow\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Richard Madden\n    \n    as\n    \n     Robb Stark\n    \n\n     (7 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Iain Glen\n    \n    as\n    \n     Jorah Mormont\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Michelle Fairley\n    \n    as\n    \n     Catelyn Stark\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Aidan Gillen\n    \n    as\n    \n     Petyr Baelish\n    \n\n     (4 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Charles Dance\n    \n    as\n    \n     Tywin Lannister\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Liam Cunningham\n    \n    as\n    \n     Davos Seaworth\n    \n\n     (4 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Stephen Dillane\n    \n    as\n    \n     Stannis Baratheon\n    \n\n     (5 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Carice van Houten\n    \n    as\n    \n     Melisandre\n    \n\n     (6 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Natalie Dormer\n    \n    as\n    \n     Margaery Tyrell\n    \n\n     (6 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Isaac Hempstead-Wright\n    \n    as\n    \n     Bran Stark\n    \n\n     (6 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Sophie Turner\n    \n    as\n    \n     Sansa Stark\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Maisie Williams\n    \n    as\n    \n     Arya Stark\n    \n\n     (9 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     Alfie Allen\n    \n    as\n    \n     Theon Greyjoy\n    \n\n     (6 episodes)\n    \n\n\n\n     John Bradley\n    \n    as\n    \n     Samwell Tarly\n    \n\n     (8 episodes)\n    \n\n\n    Oona Chaplin\n    as\n    \n     Talisa Stark\n    \n\n    ",

    "question": "who was the writer of Game of throne?",
    "response": "The Game of Thrones TV series was primarily written by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who adapted George R.R. Martin's book series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" for HBO. They served as the showrunners, executive producers, and main writers, overseeing the scripts for most episodes across all eight seasons. Bryan Cogman was another key writer for the series, contributing to episodes like \"Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things\" in Season 1 and others, and he played a significant role in maintaining the lore as a staff writer. However, it's important to note that George R.R. Martin wrote the original novels, providing the source material, while Benioff, Weiss, and Cogman handled the TV adaptation. If you're focusing on the books versus the show, Martin is the primary author, but for the TV series, Benioff and Weiss are the core creators.",

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   is an American fantasy drama television series produced by the\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   cable network.

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out. Because the third novel was so long, the production team realized it would be imposs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Bryan Cogman\n    \n\n\n      Date of birth\n     \n\n      25 July 1979\n     \n\n\n\n      Birthplace\n     \n\n      Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA\n     \n\n\n\n      Job\n     \n\n      Writer\n      Lore-master\n     \n\n\n\n\n       External links\n      \n\n\n\n\n    Robert Bryan Cogman\n   \n   (born 25 July 1979) is an American Emmy winning scriptwriter, and staff writer for\n   \n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Career\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n\n        Game of Thrones\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Credits\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Story editor\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Executive story editor\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Co-producer\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.4\n        \n\n         Producer\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.5\n        \n\n         Co-executive producer\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.6\n        \n\n         Writer\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.7\n        \n\n         Notes\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       See also\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Career\n   \n\n\n   Cogman graduated from\n   Juilliard\n   .\n  \n\n   Cogman previously worked on the short-lived series\n   \n    My Own Worst Enemy\n   \n   as a writer's assistant.\n  \n\n\n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n\n\n   Cogman worked on the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   unaired pilot episode\n   as a writing assistant to\n   \n    David Benioff\n   \n   and\n   \n    D.B. Weiss\n   \n   : he wrote the series bible outlining character and background information for the rest of the cast & crew to consult, and was known as the unofficial \"keeper of the mythos\" for the show. He also wrote the script for the fourth episode of Season 1.\n  \n\n   Originally, Cogman didn't expect to be credited as a writer in Season 1, but then Benioff and Weiss asked him to take a crack at the fourth episode. When they received his draft, they decided to give him full writing credit for the episode - which became \"\n   \n    Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things\n   \n   \". As Cogman said:\n  \n\n   Therefore Cogman considered the episode he wrote in Season 2, \"\n   \n    What Is Dead May Never Die\n   \n   \", to be the first \"true\" script he wrote for the TV series, knowing from the beginning that he was the primary writer on it.\n  \n\n   After Season 1 Cogman was promoted to story editor and staff writer, and wrote at least one script every year through Season 5. He was promoted to Co-Producer in Season 4, and a full Producer credit in Season 5.\n  \n\n   Cogman also wrote the hour-long series of animated featurettes included in the TV season Blu ray set for Season 1 (narrated by the TV series's starring cast, in-character), known as the \"\n   Complete Guide to Westeros\n   \". Although\n   Dave Hill\n   took over the writing responsibilities for the new format known as the \"\n   Histories & Lore\n   \" series, Cogman still oversaw it.\n  \n\n   In June 2014 it was announced that Cogman will also be the scriptwriter for a movie adaptation of the\n   \n    Magic: The Gathering\n   \n   fantasy card-game series.\n  \n\n\n    Credits\n   \n\n\n\n    Story editor\n

The\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   are at war, with the\n   \n\n     King in the North\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , fighting to win independence for his people and those of the\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   . Robb decides that he must win the allegiance of the fiercely independent\n   \n    ironborn\n   \n   to his cause, and sends his best friend\n   \n    Theon Greyjoy\n   \n   to treat with\n   \n    his father\n   \n   , who is hatching plans of his own. Meanwhile,\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   holds the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   with the backing of the powerful\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   , but his uncle\n   \n    Renly\n   \n   has also claimed the throne with the support of\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   , whose armies are much larger. As they struggle for the throne,\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   arrives in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   to take matters in hand, only to face opposition from his scheming sister,\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   , now the Queen Regent.\n  \n\n   However, there is another faction entering the picture.\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   , Robert's younger brother and Renly's older brother, has also claimed the Iron Throne. A proven battle commander and veteran of\n   \n    several\n   \n\n    wars\n   \n   , Stannis is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies and will do what is right even if it destroys him. Advising him is\n   \n    Melisandre\n   \n   , an enigmatic\n   \n    priestess\n   \n   from the east, who believes Stannis is meant for a\n   greater destiny\n   , and Ser\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   , an honest and honorable man uneasy with the shifts in power at Stannis' court.\n  \n\n   Far to the east,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   has hatched the only three\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   in the world. Eventually they will grow into terrifying monsters capable of destroying cities at her command, but for now they are still hatchlings and vulnerable. With her\n   \n\n     khalasar\n    \n\n   gone, Daenerys and her small band of followers must find a way across a\n   \n    forbidding wasteland\n   \n   and find new allies to support her claim to the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   In the distant north, the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   has mounted an expedition beyond the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   , searching for missing rangers and investigating rumors of\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   gathering in the mountains. For\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   this will be a rite of passage as he is asked to make difficult choices, for the realm and for himself.\n  \n\n\n    Production\n   \n\n\n   Filming of Season 2 again took place in\n   Northern Ireland\n   , on location and at the Paint Hall studio facility in\n   Belfast\n   . Additional filming, for the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   storyline, took place in\n   Iceland\n   .\n   Malta\n   was not used for filming in Season 2, with the city of\n   Dubrovnik\n   in\n   Croatia\n   standing in for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   instead and used for the new location of\n   \n    Qarth\n   \n   .\n   The production considered filming in\n   Spain\n   but ultimately

The action begins in the unified\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   as the long summer ends and winter draws near. Lord\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   is asked by his old friend, King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , to serve as the\n   \n    Hand of the King\n   \n   following the death of the previous incumbent, Eddard's mentor\n   \n    Jon Arryn\n   \n   . Eddard is reluctant but receives intelligence suggesting that Jon was murdered. Eddard accepts Robert's offer, planning to use his position and authority to investigate the alleged murder.\n  \n\n   Meanwhile, on the eastern continent of\n   \n    Essos\n   \n   , the exiled children of\n   \n    House Targaryen\n   \n   , which Robert destroyed to claim the throne, are plotting to return to Westeros and unseat the 'usurper'. To this end,\n   \n    Viserys Targaryen\n   \n   arranges the marriage of his sister\n   \n    Daenerys\n   \n   to\n   \n    Khal\n   \n\n    Drogo\n   \n   , the leader of 40,000\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   warriors, in return for the use of his warriors in invading Westeros. For her part, Daenerys just wants to find a safe refuge far away from King Robert's assassins and her brother's scheming ambition.\n  \n\n   Finally, on the northern-most border of the Seven Kingdoms the sworn brothers of the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   guard the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   , a 300-mile-long colossal fortification of ice which has stood for thousands of years. The Watch defends the Wall against the depredations of the lawless\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   who live beyond, but rumor speaks of a\n   \n    new threat\n   \n   arising in the lands of perpetual winter.\n  \n\n\n    Production\n   \n\n\n   Season 1 was mainly filmed on location in\n   Northern Ireland\n   and\n   Malta\n   , with the Paint Hall facility in\n   Belfast\n   being used as the

    "question": "What is the basic story of Game of Thrones?",
    "response": "Game of Thrones is a fantasy epic series based on George R.R. Martin's novels, centered on the power struggles among noble houses in the fictional continent of Westeros. At its core, the story revolves around the quest for the Iron Throne, a symbolic seat of power forged from the swords of conquered enemies by Aegon the Conqueror, representing ultimate authority over the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nKey themes include political intrigue, where alliances and betrayals shape the fate of kingdoms, as seen in the Iron Throne's history—passed through houses like Targaryen, Baratheon, and Lannister amid wars and rebellions. Family rivalries are prominent, with families like the Starks and Lannisters clashing over loyalty and succession, often tied to control of the throne. The quest for power drives the narrative, exemplified by events like Robert's Rebellion, the War of the Five Kings, and the throne's destruction in the final seasons, highlighting the cost of ambition and the fragility of rule.\n\nThis overview draws from the provided context on the Iron Throne's role, but for a complete story summary—including detailed plots, characters, and events—you'd need to explore the full series, as it encompasses magic, dragons, and conflicts beyond this scope.",

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Dragonstone\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Season 7\n        \n\n         Episode 1\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Airdate\n     \n\n      July 16, 2017\n     \n\n\n\n      Runtime\n     \n\n      59 minutes\n     \n\n\n\n      Written by\n     \n\n\n       David Benioff\n      \n      &\n      \n       D.B.

Lord Frey has summoned every\n   \n    Frey\n   \n   who took part in the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   under the pretext of revealing his plans. Walder orders the servants to serve them wine from the\n   \n    Arbor\n   \n   but harshly tells his latest wife\n   Kitty Frey\n   that he is not wasting any wine on \"a damn woman\". Walder thanks his family for helping him to slaughter the\n   \n    Starks\n   \n   and backhandedly compliments his brood for the violent deaths of\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , his wife\n   \n    Talisa Stark\n   \n   , their unborn child, and Lady\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   , much to the nervous laughter of his family.\n  \n\n   However, when the Freys begin to choke from poisoned wine, Walder chides them for not killing all the Starks. Walder remarks, \"Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe,\" as his family members die around him. \"Walder\" then reveals himself as a disguised\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   , who has exacted vengeance on those who arranged the massacre of her mother and brother at the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   . Arya spares Walder's\n   wife\n   and the servants. She tells them, \"The North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\"\n  \n\n   Later, Arya, having acquired a horse, is riding south when she stumbles upon a group of\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   soldiers who have been sent to the Twins to keep law and order. The soldiers are singing \"Hands of Gold\" and offer to share rabbit meat for dinner. When the soldiers ask why she is riding south, Arya tells them that she is traveling to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Arya learns from the soldiers that the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   and its surroundings have been\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and that the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   has been essentially sealed. The young soldiers insist that she join them around the campfire to eat and rest. When she asks about their adventures, the soldiers admit that they are homesick and once they left home they wished to return to their families. The young soldier offers her blackberry wine while his brother in arms asks why she is traveling south. Arya tells them that she is going to kill\n   \n    the Queen\n   \n   . Thinking that she is joking, they all burst out laughing. Arya smiles and laughs with them.\n  \n\n   Elsewhere,\n   \n    Sandor Clegane\n   \n   is riding north with the\n   \n    Brotherhood Without Banners\n   \n   , through thick snow. They decide to take shelter for the night at an abandoned home but Sandor, recognizing the house, declares it unsafe.\n   \n    Beric Dondarrion\n   \n   dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter the house where they discover the corpses of the\n   Farmer\n   and his daughter\n   Sally\n   , whom he and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.\n  \n\n   Sandor recalls seeing Beric at the tournament at\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , and wonders aloud why Beric keeps getting resurrected, as there's nothing special about him. Beric confides that he does not know what\n   \n    R'hllor\n   \n   , the Lord of Light, is telling him. Sandor remarks that he does not believe in divine justice, citing the fate of the farmer and his daughter. Despite Sandor's fear of flames, Thoros tells him to look into the fire. He tells him that only the fire can show him what the Lord of Light wants him to see. At first, Sandor can only see burning logs, but then, to his own shock, he sees a\n   \n    Wall of Ice\n   \n   . He also sees a\n   \n    castle where the Wall meets the sea\n   \n   , a mountain that looks like an arrowhead, and thousands of the\n   \n    dead\n   \n   marching past. Beric asks Sandor if he now believes that they are here for a reason.\n  \n\n   Later,\n   \n    Thoros\n   \n   finds Sandor burying the dead farmer and his daughter Sally in the snow. Thoros deduces that Sandor knew the dead, but Sandor admits that he doesn't. The two of them bury the bodies together, and Sandor attempts to deliver an epitaph to\n   the Seven\n   , but can't remember the rest of the verse. Instead, he simply tells the dead that they deserve better.\n  \n\n\n    At Winterfell\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , the\n   \n    King in the North\n   \n\n    Jon Snow\n   \n   organizes the defense of the North against the Night King and his army of the dead. He asks that all maesters start searching for\n   \n    dragonglass\n   \n   , stressing it is now more valuable than gold due to its effectiveness against the White Walkers. Jon also requests that Tormund and his people man Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as Tormund and the other wildlings were present at Hardhome and have seen the Night King and Tormund agrees to defend this castle. Jon orders for all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 in his kingdom to be trained in combat in order to defend against the encroaching threat of the White Walkers. Because having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough, he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. When\n   Robett Glover\n   balks at the idea of arming his young granddaughter,\n   \n    Lady\n   \n\n    Lyanna Mormont\n   \n   remarks that she certainly will not remain idle and volunteers to help, giving her assurance that every girl on\n   \n    Bear Island\n   \n   will be trained alongside the boys. The words of the young lady once more remind the older lords of their place and they agree.\n  \n\n   The next order of business is the possibility of the Walkers getting past the wall; if they do, Jon notes that the first obstacles they encounter will be the castles of\n   \n    Last Hearth\n   \n   and\n   Karhold\n   , the seats belonging to the two Northern houses that fought alongside the Boltons. Lord\n   \n    Yohn Royce\n   \n   opines that the castles should be demolished for their lords' treachery, but\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   interjects that Last Hearth and Karhold committed no crimes and urges her half-brother to instead strip the\n   \n    Umbers\n   \n   and\n   \n    Karstarks\n   \n   of their castles as punishment for turning against the Starks. However, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and she reluctantly obliges. Jon then summons\n   Ned Umber\n   and\n   Alys Karstark\n   - both of whom are children who obviously played no part in their father's betrayal and are clearly terrified of what will happen to them. He asks them to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore.\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   watches the proceedings with a smile.\n  \n\n   In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies. He tells Sansa that while she is his sister and she can question his decisions, doing so when he is publicly addressing the Northern lords and ladies undermines his position with them. When Sansa responds that the late\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   did not tolerate dissent, Jon reassures her that h \n\n\n\n\n   The\n   \n\n     Tales of Dunk and Egg\n    \n\n   are a series of prequel novellas written by\n   \n    George R.R. Martin\n   \n   , which begin 90 years before the events of the\n   \n\n     A Song of Ice and Fire\n    \n\n   novels (on which the TV series\n   \n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   is based). They follow the adventures of Ser\n   Duncan the Tall\n   and his squire, Prince\n   \n    Aegon \"Egg\" Targaryen\n   \n   who is the younger brother of Maester\n   \n    Aemon\n   \n   . Though Egg is a boy at the start of the series he will eventually grow up to become King Aegon V, or \"Aegon the Unlikely\".\n  \n\n   The\n   \n    Tales of Dunk and Egg\n   \n   may potentially be made into a live-action project which will be a prequel to the main\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series.

The realm is still recovering from the First\n   Blackfyre Rebellion\n   thirteen years before, a great civil war that tore the Seven Kingdoms in half. Daeron II's bastard half-brother\n   Daemon I Blackfyre\n   had tried to seize the\n   \n    throne\n   \n   in the rebellion, but was killed in the final battle of the war. Several of his sons survived by fleeing into exile, and across the\n   \n    Narrow Sea\n   \n   ,\n   House Blackfyre\n   is continually plotting all manner of intrigues against the main branch of the\n   \n    Targaryen dynasty\n   \n   , hoping to gain support for new rebellions.\n  \n\n   The Targaryens are still having difficulty maintaining their hold on power, particularly since the last of their\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   died fifty years ago, and the beasts are starting to fade from living memory. There are also lingering tensions from the recent unification of\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   with the rest of the Seven Kingdoms. The fiercely independent\n   \n    Dornishmen\n   \n   had resisted Targaryen conquest for two centuries, and only finally came under the authority of the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   through peaceful marriage-alliance. Daeron II married the sister of the Prince of Dorne, and Daeron II's sister married the Prince of Dorne. The terms of the alliance led to the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   giving\n   \n    House Martell\n   \n   of Dorne preferential treatment, with a strong pro-Martell faction developing around Daeron II at the royal court. This is one of the factors that sparked the Blackfyre Rebellion, as all of the non-Dornish lords who felt that the pro-Martell faction was receiving royal favors which should have been theirs ultimately sided with Daemon Blackfyre. Despite thirteen years of relative peace, relations between the Dornish and the rest of the Seven Kingdoms remain tenuous.\n  \n\n   Worse problems are on the horizon, as during the course of Dunk and Egg's first adventures a massive plague known as the\n   Great Spring Sickness\n   sweeps across the Seven Kingdoms (\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   's equivalent of the\n   Black Death\n   ), upsetting what was already a fragile political balance. With plague and drought devastating the Seven Kingdoms, many turn to banditry to survive, and the roads are crawling with outlaw bands. Petty feuds erupt between local lords competing over food and resources. With the realm weakened from within, dangers arise on every side, as the Targaryens' enemies see their vulnerable state as a perfect opportunity to attack. Besides the continuing tensions with the Dornish to the south, the Blackfyres across the eastern sea are attempting to raise new armies in the\n   \n    Free Cities\n   \n   , and to turn lords in Westeros to their side who are upset at the difficulties the Targaryen reign is encountering. To the west, the\n   \n    ironborn\n   \n   led by Dagon Greyjoy are seizing their best chance in generations to return to the Old Way, conducting brazen coastal raids from\n   \n    Bear Island\n   \n   in the North to the\n   \n    Arbor\n   \n   in the south. To the north the\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   have been united by a new\n   \n    King-Beyond-the-Wall\n   \n   ,\n   Raymun Redbeard\n   , and they are preparing to cross over the Wall and sweep through the lands to the south.\n  \n\n   Into this backdrop steps Ser\n   Duncan the Tall\n   , a very large squire who grew up as an orphan in the slums of\n   Flea Bottom\n   in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . After the hedge knight he is in service to dies while heading to a tournament, Dunk takes his gear and enters the tournament as a knight himself. Along the way he strikes up an odd friendship with a young boy who turns out to be Prince Aegon Targaryen, commonly known by his nickname \"Egg\", a grandson of King Daeron II. Later, however, he runs afoul of Aegon's sadistic and arrogant older brother, Prince\n   Aerion Brighflame\n   , after Aerion accosts\n   a beautiful Dornish woman\n   with whom Duncan becomes smitten. Through a series of many adventures the unlikely duo of \"Dunk and Egg\" will, in the course of years, rise to great fame, as Egg grows to become King Aegon V, and Dunk becomes Ser Duncan the Tall, Lord Commander of the\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Martin has said that the novellas will include time-jumps so that they will ultimately cover the rest of the lives of the two main characters, stretching across a period of 50 years, until both of them die in the\n   Tragedy at Summerhall\n   . This will bridge the timeline between the two main narrative eras: Ser\n   \n    Barristan Selmy\n   \n   was knighted at the age of sixteen by King Aegon V after unhorsing Ser Duncan in a joust.\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   's grandfather Gerold Lannister is a character in the early novellas, but young Tywin was a boy when Aegon V died. Prince\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   was also born the very same night as the\n   Tragedy at Summerhall\n   .\n  \n\n\n    Potential adaptation\n   \n\n\n   On February 10, 2013, George R.R. Martin confirmed that he had been in discussion with\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   over a possible adaptation of the\n   \n    Tales of Dunk and Egg\n   \n   short stories, though in what format (TV movies, theatrical movie, or a spin-off TV series) was not made clear.\n  \n\n   The HBO production team from the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series has said that they dismiss out of hand the possibility of starting any prequel project before the main series if finished, given the massive amount of work involved on it. They physically cannot produce more than ten episodes on any Westeros-related project in a single year. While potential future prequel projects are being discussed, this is mostly legal negotiation at this point, and no pre-production work will be started until after the final season of\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Before the beginning of Season 5 of\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   , HBO programming president Michael Lombardo said in an interview with\n   \n    Entertainment Weekly\n   \n   that the network would eagerly accept the TV series going on for eight to ten seasons, but only if writers Benioff and Weiss felt it served the story instead of dragging it out.\n   This strongly indicates that HBO is interested in continuing to make Westeros-related projects for years to come, such as moving on to a\n   \n    Tales of Dunk and Egg\n   \n   prequel after the main series ends.\n  \n\n   The main\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series has made a few alterations to the overall TV continuity which will affect later seasons of any live-action\n   \n    Tales of Dunk and Egg\n   \n   TV series. In the novels,\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the \"Mad King\" overthrown in\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   - was Aegon V's\n   \n    grandson\n   \n   . In the novels, the Mad King's father was Jaehaerys II, Aegon V's eldest son. Jaehaerys II had notoriously poor health and died young after only ruling three years, but during that time he ruled well, and effectively dealt with the\n   War of the Ninepenny Kings\n   (the fifth and last\n   Blackfyre Rebellion\n   ). Season 1 of\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   , however, established that the Mad King is actually Egg's son, not his grandson, and the TV producers have confirmed that Jaehaerys II simply does not exist in the TV continuity. Possibly this means that Aegon V's other children (who are characters in the prequel era) have been omitted as well, though the full after-effects of removing an entire generation from the royal family are unknown.\n  \n\n   In the novels, the era of Aegon V's reign also saw the slow decline of\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   under Gerold's incompetent third son\n   \n    Tytos Lannister\n   \n   , whose hold on power in the\n   \n    Westerlands\n   \n   became so weak that Aegon V actually had to militarily intervene several times to restore order. The very end of the elderly Aegon V's reign, extending into Jaehaerys II's short reign, saw the rise of the young\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , ruthless, cunning, and capable in all of the ways his father was not. First rising to fame as a young warrior in the War of the Ninepenny Kings (not unlike the later\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   ), Tywin set about single-handedly rebuilding House Lannister from a laughingstock into the most powerful House in the Seven Kingdoms. During this span of decades the intense rivalry between the Lannisters and their upstart vassals\n   House Reyne\n   played out, culminating in the\n   Reyne Rebellion\n   , during which Tywin wiped out all of his rivals. Aerys II was so impressed with how Tywin crushed his enemies that he named him the new\n   \n    Hand of the King\n   \n   , a position he held for nearly twenty years - before resigning and later\n   \n    betraying\n   \n   Aerys II to his death in\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The TV continuity removed Jaehaerys",

    "response": "The \"best\" character in Game of Thrones is really a matter of personal taste, as it depends on what you value most—like heroism, cunning, or emotional depth. Based on fan discussions and the show's story, many people point to Jon Snow as a top favorite. He's portrayed as a principled leader who fights for the greater good, dealing with themes of duty and survival, which makes him compelling in the context of the series' epic battles and political intrigue.\n\nOther characters like Daenerys Targaryen stand out for her determination and quest for justice, or Arya Stark for her resourcefulness and growth. If you're drawing from the context, these examples show the rich character development in the show. Who do you think is the best, or what draws you to a particular character? I'd love to hear your thoughts to keep the conversation going!",

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out.

Lord Frey has summoned every\n   \n    Frey\n   \n   who took part in the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   under the pretext of revealing his plans. Walder orders the servants to serve them wine from the\n   \n    Arbor\n   \n   but harshly tells his latest wife\n   Kitty Frey\n   that he is not wasting any wine on \"a damn woman\". Walder thanks his family for helping him to slaughter the\n   \n    Starks\n   \n   and backhandedly compliments his brood for the violent deaths of\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , his wife\n   \n    Talisa Stark\n   \n   , their unborn child, and Lady\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   , much to the nervous laughter of his family.\n  \n\n   However, when the Freys begin to choke from poisoned wine, Walder chides them for not killing all the Starks. Walder remarks, \"Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe,\" as his family members die around him. \"Walder\" then reveals himself as a disguised\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   , who has exacted vengeance on those who arranged the massacre of her mother and brother at the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   . Arya spares Walder's\n   wife\n   and the servants. She tells them, \"The North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\"\n  \n\n   Later, Arya, having acquired a horse, is riding south when she stumbles upon a group of\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   soldiers who have been sent to the Twins to keep law and order. The soldiers are singing \"Hands of Gold\" and offer to share rabbit meat for dinner. When the soldiers ask why she is riding south, Arya tells them that she is traveling to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Arya learns from the soldiers that the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   and its surroundings have been\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and that the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   has been essentially sealed. The young soldiers insist that she join them around the campfire to eat and rest. When she asks about their adventures, the soldiers admit that they are homesick and once they left home they wished to return to their families. The young soldier offers her blackberry wine while his brother in arms asks why she is traveling south. Arya tells them that she is going to kill\n   \n    the Queen\n   \n   . Thinking that she is joking, they all burst out laughing. Arya smiles and laughs with them.\n  \n\n   Elsewhere,\n   \n    Sandor Clegane\n   \n   is riding north with the\n   \n    Brotherhood Without Banners\n   \n   , through thick snow. They decide to take shelter for the night at an abandoned home but Sandor, recognizing the house, declares it unsafe.\n   \n    Beric Dondarrion\n   \n   dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter the house where they discover the corpses of the\n   Farmer\n   and his daughter\n   Sally\n   , whom he and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.\n  \n\n   Sandor recalls seeing Beric at the tournament at\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , and wonders aloud why Beric keeps getting resurrected, as there's nothing special about him. Beric confides that he does not know what\n   \n    R'hllor\n   \n   , the Lord of Light, is telling him. Sandor remarks that he does not believe in divine justice, citing the fate of the farmer and his daughter. Despite Sandor's fear of flames, Thoros tells him to look into the fire. He tells him that only the fire can show him what the Lord of Light wants him to see. At first, Sandor can only see burning logs, but then, to his own shock, he sees a\n   \n    Wall of Ice\n   \n   . He also sees a\n   \n    castle where the Wall meets the sea\n   \n   , a mountain that looks like an arrowhead, and thousands of the\n   \n    dead\n   \n   marching past. Beric asks Sandor if he now believes that they are here for a reason.\n  \n\n   Later,\n   \n    Thoros\n   \n   finds Sandor burying the dead farmer and his daughter Sally in the snow. Thoros deduces that Sandor knew the dead, but Sandor admits that he doesn't. The two of them bury the bodies together, and Sandor attempts to deliver an epitaph to\n   the Seven\n   , but can't remember the rest of the verse. Instead, he simply tells the dead that they deserve better.\n  \n\n\n    At Winterfell\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , the\n   \n    King in the North\n   \n\n    Jon Snow\n   \n   organizes the defense of the North against the Night King and his army of the dead. He asks that all maesters start searching for\n   \n    dragonglass\n   \n   , stressing it is now more valuable than gold due to its effectiveness against the White Walkers. Jon also requests that Tormund and his people man Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as Tormund and the other wildlings were present at Hardhome and have seen the Night King and Tormund agrees to defend this castle. Jon orders for all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 in his kingdom to be trained in combat in order to defend against the encroaching threat of the White Walkers. Because having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough, he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. When\n   Robett Glover\n   balks at the idea of arming his young granddaughter,\n   \n    Lady\n   \n\n    Lyanna Mormont\n   \n   remarks that she certainly will not remain idle and volunteers to help, giving her assurance that every girl on\n   \n    Bear Island\n   \n   will be trained alongside the boys. The words of the young lady once more remind the older lords of their place and they agree.\n  \n\n   The next order of business is the possibility of the Walkers getting past the wall; if they do, Jon notes that the first obstacles they encounter will be the castles of\n   \n    Last Hearth\n   \n   and\n   Karhold\n   , the seats belonging to the two Northern houses that fought alongside the Boltons. Lord\n   \n    Yohn Royce\n   \n   opines that the castles should be demolished for their lords' treachery, but\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   interjects that Last Hearth and Karhold committed no crimes and urges her half-brother to instead strip the\n   \n    Umbers\n   \n   and\n   \n    Karstarks\n   \n   of their castles as punishment for turning against the Starks. However, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and she reluctantly obliges. Jon then summons\n   Ned Umber\n   and\n   Alys Karstark\n   - both of whom are children who obviously played no part in their father's betrayal and are clearly terrified of what will happen to them. He asks them to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore.\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   watches the proceedings with a smile.\n  \n\n   In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies. He tells Sansa that while she is his sister and she can question his decisions, doing so when he is publicly addressing the Northern lords and ladies undermines his position with them. When Sansa responds that the late\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   did not tolerate dissent, Jon reassures her that h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Conleth Hill\n    \n\n\n      Date of birth\n     \n\n      November 24,1964\n     \n\n\n\n      Birthplace\n     \n\n      Ballycastle, Northern Ireland\n     \n\n\n\n      Role\n     \n\n\n       Varys\n      \n\n\n\n\n      First episode\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       Lord Snow\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Last episode\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       The Bells\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n\n       External links\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Conleth Seamus Eoin Croiston Hill\n   \n   (born 24 November 1964) is a Northern Irish film, stage and television actor.

    "question": "What is the Game of Thrones?",
    "response": "Game of Thrones is a critically acclaimed fantasy television series based on George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" novels. It follows the intense power struggles among noble families in the fictional world of Westeros (and beyond), as they compete for control of the Iron Throne—a symbolic seat of power forged from melted swords by Aegon the Conqueror, who unified six of the Seven Kingdoms centuries ago. The series weaves together political intrigue, epic battles, and supernatural elements, like dragons and the looming threat of White Walkers.\n\nKey elements include:\n- **Characters**: Figures like Daenerys Targaryen, who aims to reclaim the Iron Throne as the last Targaryen heir; Jon Snow, a leader in the North defending against ancient threats; and Cersei Lannister, a cunning ruler who sits on the throne amid chaos.\n- **Plotlines**: The story revolves around wars like the War of the Five Kings, alliances, betrayals, and personal vendettas, such as Arya's quest for revenge or the defense against the dead.\n- **Historical Background**: It draws from events like Aegon's conquest and Robert's Rebellion, showing how the past shapes the present struggles.\n\nIf you're new to it, think of it as a gripping tale of ambition and survival—perfect for diving into themes of power and loyalty. What part interests you most, like the battles or the characters?",

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Conleth Hill\n    \n\n\n      Date of birth\n     \n\n      November 24,1964\n     \n\n\n\n      Birthplace\n     \n\n      Ballycastle, Northern Ireland\n     \n\n\n\n      Role\n     \n\n\n       Varys\n      \n\n\n\n\n      First episode\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       Lord Snow\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Last episode\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       The Bells\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n\n       External links\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Conleth Seamus Eoin Croiston Hill\n   \n   (born 24 November 1964) is a Northern Irish film, stage and television actor.

the performance of many actors (even Sean Bean as Ned Stark), few of them come close to exactly how he pictured them acting in his mind.\n  \n\n\n    Credits\n   \n\n\n\n    Guest starring\n

Lord Frey has summoned every\n   \n    Frey\n   \n   who took part in the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   under the pretext of revealing his plans. Walder orders the servants to serve them wine from the\n   \n    Arbor\n   \n   but harshly tells his latest wife\n   Kitty Frey\n   that he is not wasting any wine on \"a damn woman\". Walder thanks his family for helping him to slaughter the\n   \n    Starks\n   \n   and backhandedly compliments his brood for the violent deaths of\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , his wife\n   \n    Talisa Stark\n   \n   , their unborn child, and Lady\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   , much to the nervous laughter of his family.\n  \n\n   However, when the Freys begin to choke from poisoned wine, Walder chides them for not killing all the Starks. Walder remarks, \"Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe,\" as his family members die around him. \"Walder\" then reveals himself as a disguised\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   , who has exacted vengeance on those who arranged the massacre of her mother and brother at the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   . Arya spares Walder's\n   wife\n   and the servants. She tells them, \"The North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\"\n  \n\n   Later, Arya, having acquired a horse, is riding south when she stumbles upon a group of\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   soldiers who have been sent to the Twins to keep law and order. The soldiers are singing \"Hands of Gold\" and offer to share rabbit meat for dinner. When the soldiers ask why she is riding south, Arya tells them that she is traveling to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Arya learns from the soldiers that the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   and its surroundings have been\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and that the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   has been essentially sealed. The young soldiers insist that she join them around the campfire to eat and rest. When she asks about their adventures, the soldiers admit that they are homesick and once they left home they wished to return to their families. The young soldier offers her blackberry wine while his brother in arms asks why she is traveling south. Arya tells them that she is going to kill\n   \n    the Queen\n   \n   . Thinking that she is joking, they all burst out laughing. Arya smiles and laughs with them.\n  \n\n   Elsewhere,\n   \n    Sandor Clegane\n   \n   is riding north with the\n   \n    Brotherhood Without Banners\n   \n   , through thick snow. They decide to take shelter for the night at an abandoned home but Sandor, recognizing the house, declares it unsafe.\n   \n    Beric Dondarrion\n   \n   dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter the house where they discover the corpses of the\n   Farmer\n   and his daughter\n   Sally\n   , whom he and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.\n  \n\n   Sandor recalls seeing Beric at the tournament at\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , and wonders aloud why Beric keeps getting resurrected, as there's nothing special about him. Beric confides that he does not know what\n   \n    R'hllor\n   \n   , the Lord of Light, is telling him. Sandor remarks that he does not believe in divine justice, citing the fate of the farmer and his daughter. Despite Sandor's fear of flames, Thoros tells him to look into the fire. He tells him that only the fire can show him what the Lord of Light wants him to see. At first, Sandor can only see burning logs, but then, to his own shock, he sees a\n   \n    Wall of Ice\n   \n   . He also sees a\n   \n    castle where the Wall meets the sea\n   \n   , a mountain that looks like an arrowhead, and thousands of the\n   \n    dead\n   \n   marching past. Beric asks Sandor if he now believes that they are here for a reason.\n  \n\n   Later,\n   \n    Thoros\n   \n   finds Sandor burying the dead farmer and his daughter Sally in the snow. Thoros deduces that Sandor knew the dead, but Sandor admits that he doesn't. The two of them bury the bodies together, and Sandor attempts to deliver an epitaph to\n   the Seven\n   , but can't remember the rest of the verse. Instead, he simply tells the dead that they deserve better.\n  \n\n\n    At Winterfell\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , the\n   \n    King in the North\n   \n\n    Jon Snow\n   \n   organizes the defense of the North against the Night King and his army of the dead. He asks that all maesters start searching for\n   \n    dragonglass\n   \n   , stressing it is now more valuable than gold due to its effectiveness against the White Walkers. Jon also requests that Tormund and his people man Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as Tormund and the other wildlings were present at Hardhome and have seen the Night King and Tormund agrees to defend this castle. Jon orders for all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 in his kingdom to be trained in combat in order to defend against the encroaching threat of the White Walkers. Because having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough, he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. When\n   Robett Glover\n   balks at the idea of arming his young granddaughter,\n   \n    Lady\n   \n\n    Lyanna Mormont\n   \n   remarks that she certainly will not remain idle and volunteers to help, giving her assurance that every girl on\n   \n    Bear Island\n   \n   will be trained alongside the boys. The words of the young lady once more remind the older lords of their place and they agree.\n  \n\n   The next order of business is the possibility of the Walkers getting past the wall; if they do, Jon notes that the first obstacles they encounter will be the castles of\n   \n    Last Hearth\n   \n   and\n   Karhold\n   , the seats belonging to the two Northern houses that fought alongside the Boltons. Lord\n   \n    Yohn Royce\n   \n   opines that the castles should be demolished for their lords' treachery, but\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   interjects that Last Hearth and Karhold committed no crimes and urges her half-brother to instead strip the\n   \n    Umbers\n   \n   and\n   \n    Karstarks\n   \n   of their castles as punishment for turning against the Starks. However, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and she reluctantly obliges. Jon then summons\n   Ned Umber\n   and\n   Alys Karstark\n   - both of whom are children who obviously played no part in their father's betrayal and are clearly terrified of what will happen to them. He asks them to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore.\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   watches the proceedings with a smile.\n  \n\n   In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies. He tells Sansa that while she is his sister and she can question his decisions, doing so when he is publicly addressing the Northern lords and ladies undermines his position with them. When Sansa responds that the late\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   did not tolerate dissent, Jon reassures her that h",

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R. Martin has predicted that there will be two more (though he is struggling not to let the final book run long, in which case it would have to be split, for a total of eight books).\n  \n\n   The third novel,\n   \n    A Storm of Swords\n   \n   , was so long that it pushed the limits of how large a published book could physically be without pages falling out.

The crazed boy-king\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   , Tywin's grandson, is also dead after being poisoned at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , and succeeded by his younger and more pliable brother,\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   . Queen\n   \n    Cersei Lannister\n   \n   succeeds her father as the head of\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   , and once again takes over as\n   Queen Regent\n   , as Tommen has yet to come of age. Cersei has been blocked by several powerful men over the years, including her husband King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   and his friend\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   , but due to her betrayals they are both dead. Now with even Tywin and Joffrey dead, and Tyrion fleeing the realm, there are no more checks on Cersei's power, and she is essentially the Ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms in all but name. However, Cersei is neither a master strategist nor a skilled diplomat (unlike her father and brother) and she faces mounting crises that would have strained even their abilities.\n  \n\n   House Lannister and its allies have managed to crush\n   \n    House Stark\n   \n   , but in many ways it was a pyrrhic victory. The\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   was already in\n   massive debt\n   to foreign banks before the war even began, and the Lannisters' immense wartime spending increased the crown's debts to crippling levels. The Lannisters must now desperately attempt to placate the\n   \n    Iron Bank of Braavos\n   \n   , by far the largest of the foreign banks, and the one which the crown owes most of its huge debts to.\n  \n\n   The game of thrones is, unfortunately, not a simple game of\n   \n    cyvasse\n   \n   in which the pieces can be quickly reassembled: vast swathes of Westeros have been devastated by civil war, and it may take a full generation for them to rebuild. The\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   , where most of the war was fought, have been reduced to a burned out husk. Nominally the Lannisters and their\n   \n    House Frey\n   \n   allies control the Riverlands, but it has been reduced to a lawless and corpse-filled devastation, hardly controlled by anyone. Winter is fast approaching, but instead of stockpiling harvests the past few years, the great lords have been busy destroying one of the main breadbasket regions of the Seven Kingdoms. Combined with the realm's massive debts to foreign banks, starvation level conditions are starting to set in for the\n   smallfolk\n   across the realm. Outraged by the willful indifference of their rulers to their well-being for so long, commoners are starting to fall back onto old cultural touchstones, channeling their frustration into religious fanaticism. A\n   popular disgust movement\n   spreads across Westeros, and makes its way to the capital.\n  \n\n   Adding to these woes is the increasing rivalry between the Lannisters and their Tyrell allies, specifically between Cersei and\n   \n    Margaery Tyrell\n   \n   . The Lannisters only managed to win on the battlefield with the armies and food resources won by their alliance with the\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   of the\n   \n    Reach\n   \n   . Now that Tywin is dead, and Margaery is soon to be King Tommen's queen, the Tyrells are no longer pretending to be polite to the Lannisters, but openly demanding greater concessions and key positions of power. With half of the Lannister armies slaughtered by\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   during the war, their financial resources depleted, and the Tyrells controlling the only major breadbasket region untouched by the war, the Lannisters are having to face the reality that the Tyrells hold numerous advantages over them. Just as\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   became king only to become dependent on the support of the Lannisters, the Lannisters have now become dependant on the Tyrells.\n  \n\n   Without the political acumen of Tywin or Tyrion, Queen Regent Cersei struggles to address these major challenges. Adding even further to her woes is that the king's\n   \n    small council\n   \n   has been gutted, with\n   Hand of the King\n   Tywin dead,\n   \n    Master of Coin\n   \n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   leaving for the\n   \n    Eyrie\n   \n   , and both Tyrion and\n   Master of Whisperers\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   fleeing the capital city. Of the original small council when the Lannisters first seized power, only\n   \n    Grand Maester\n   \n\n    Pycelle\n   \n   remains.\n  \n\n   Besides the Reach, only the regions which have remained neutral so far still have all of their armies and resources intact: the\n   \n    Vale\n   \n   , ruled by\n   \n    House Arryn\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   , ruled by\n   \n    House Martell\n   \n   . With nearly all the other Great Houses defeated or half-exhausted, the fresh armies of the Vale and Dorne can drastically alter the political playing field, depending on which side they choose to join.\n  \n\n   The ultimate result of the war was to exhaust the Starks, Lannisters, and other\n   \n    Great Houses\n   \n   of the Seven Kingdoms - exactly as Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish had planned. The secret architect of the conflict, it was Littlefinger who was responsible for poisoning Robert's Hand,\n   \n    Jon Arryn\n   \n   , by conspiring with his own wife\n   \n    Lysa Arryn\n   \n   . Littlefinger then engineered the betrayal of\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   , only to later assist\n   \n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   in assassinating King Joffrey\n   \n    at his own wedding\n   \n   . Baelish has now murdered Lysa, mere days after wedding her, and seized power over the Vale as regent for her young son. For the moment, Baelish remains in the Vale, consolidating his new hold over the Vale lords through his stepson\n   \n    Robin\n   \n   and his position as Lord Protector of the Vale. Alongside Baelish is the black-haired \"Alayne\", his ward and \"niece\" - secretly,\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   , who fell into Littlefinger's custody after he helped her escape her long imprisonment at Joffrey's royal court.\n  \n\n   In the deserts of the deep south of Westeros, the people of\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   demand vengeance for the death of Prince\n   \n    Oberyn\n   \n   , who died in a\n   trial by combat\n   at the hands of Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   . Leading the call to enter the war against the Lannisters are Oberyn's paramour,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and the eldest of\n   \n    his eight daughters\n   \n   :\n   Obara\n   ,\n   Nymeria\n   , and\n   \n    Tyene\n   \n   . But\n   \n    Doran Martell\n   \n   , the\n   Prince of Dorne\n   and Oberyn's older brother, continues to urge restraint. Further complicating the matter is that early in the war, the Lannisters bribed the Martells into staying neutral by offering a marriage-alliance, sending Cersei's daughter\n   \n    Myrcella\n   \n   to Dorne to betroth her to Doran's son\n   \n    Trystane\n   \n   . Myrcella is still a\n   ward\n   living in Dorne's capital,\n   \n    Sunspear\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The most dire situation in Westeros, however, is in the\n   \n    North\n   \n   and at the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   .

In one swift move, she has eliminated nearly all of her enemies, rivals, and obstructions; Queen\n   \n    Margaery Tyrell\n   \n   , Lord\n   \n    Mace Tyrell\n   \n   , Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   , Cersei's uncle Ser\n   \n    Kevan Lannister\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Grand Maester\n   \n\n    Pycelle\n   \n   , the\n   \n    High Sparrow\n   \n   , and most of - if not all - members of the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   were killed when the\n   Great Sept of Baelor\n   was\n   destroyed\n   using large amounts of\n   \n    wildfire\n   \n   , an event orchestrated by Cersei. She has crowned herself the undisputed Queen of the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   , with\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   as her\n   Hand\n   and the undead\n   \n    knight\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   at her side. After nearly four decades of serving as the power behind the throne,\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   has finally become the new royal house. However, Cersei is still haunted by the prophecy she was told during her childhood, which claimed that the deaths of her three (future) children would predate her own;\n   \n    Joffrey\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Myrcella\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   are all dead, Tommen having taken his own life shortly after the Sept's destruction. This has made Cersei all the more determined to crush her enemies once and for all, but the number of her enemies has just increased exponentially. Though she now sits on the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   , she has effectively undone all of\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   's efforts to ensure that his family stay in power as her actions have undoubtedly earned her the hatred of all of Westeros. Most of the realm is either in open rebellion against the Iron Throne or has fallen out of her allies' control, leaving Cersei effectively as the Queen of King's Landing and the lands owned by the Lannisters. It is the beginning of the end.\n  \n\n   In the\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   , the last bastion of\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   's independent\n   Northern-Riverland kingdom\n   ,\n   \n    Riverrun\n   \n   , has fallen to House Lannister and\n   \n    House Frey\n   \n   in a\n   siege\n   led by Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   . Lord\n   \n    Edmure Tully\n   \n   , who had been held hostage by the Freys ever since the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   , ordered the Tully garrison to stand down for the sake of his\n   \n    wife\n   \n   and\n   child\n   , whom Jaime had violently threatened if Edmure refused to cooperate. Edmure's uncle,\n   \n    Brynden \"The Blackfish\" Tully\n   \n   , is dead, having chosen to fight to the death rather than surrender.\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   and her squire,\n   \n    Podrick Payne\n   \n   , had traveled to Riverrun in an attempt to recruit the Blackfish to assist\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   in reclaiming\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   from\n   \n    House Bolton\n   \n   . The attempt failed, and they were only barely able to escape when the castle fell.\n  \n\n   Although House Frey has reclaimed Riverrun, Lord\n   \n    Walder Frey\n   \n   is also dead.\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   , despite nearly being killed by the\n   Waif\n   and ultimately overcoming the assassin in single combat, has completed her training as a\n   \n    Faceless Man\n   \n   in the\n   Free City\n   of\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   . With her original mission clearly back in focus, she has abandoned the Order and returned to Westeros to cross more names off of her list of vengeance, starting with Walder Frey, the last surviving orchestrator of the Red Wedding that claimed the lives of her\n   \n    mother\n   \n   ,\n   \n    brother\n   \n   , and pregnant\n   \n    sister-in-law\n   \n   , at the same time butchering Walder's two most prominent sons,\n   \n    Lothar Frey\n   \n   and\n   \n    Walder Rivers\n   \n   who also helped carry out the massacre, and leaving the rule of the Riverlands in unknown hands. Also,\n   \n    Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane\n   \n   has survived his brutal fight with Brienne of Tarth and attempted to build a new, humble life, but has been dragged back into conflict by the\n   \n    Brotherhood Without Banners\n   \n   , who intend to head north to fight in the war that is coming.\n  \n\n   On the\n   \n    Iron Islands\n   \n   ,\n   King\n   \n    Balon Greyjoy\n   \n   is dead, having been murdered by his psychopathic younger brother,\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   . Balon's son,\n   \n    Theon\n   \n   , returned to the Iron Islands after helping Sansa Stark escape from\n   \n    Ramsay Bolton\n   \n   and endorsed his elder sister,\n   \n    Yara\n   \n   , as their father's successor at the subsequent\n   Kingsmoot\n   . However, Euron has claimed and won the\n   Salt Throne\n   by promising an alliance with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   , which he will use to conquer the Seven Kingdoms. In desperation, and in fear for their lives, Theon and Yara have stolen a hundred ships from the\n   Iron Fleet\n   . With sailors and soldiers loyal to them, they have traveled to\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   and sought out Daenerys's help first. They have managed to secure an alliance between\n   \n    House Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    House Greyjoy\n   \n   to help Daenerys retake the Iron Throne and overthrow Euron in return for the Iron Islands' independence. Euron, however, has ordered the construction of an even bigger fleet to begin his own invasions, seek out new alliances and destroy all who may stand in his way of taking the Seven Kingdoms for himself.\n  \n\n   Also aiding Daenerys are the\n   Dornish\n   and the\n   \n    Tyrells\n   \n   , the\n   rulers\n   of the\n   \n    Reach\n   \n   . In\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Sand Snakes\n   \n   have staged a\n   coup\n   ; they have murdered Prince\n   \n    Doran Martell\n   \n   and his heir,\n   \n    Trystane\n   \n   , and taken control of Dorne in retaliation for Doran's refusal to wage war against House Lannister after the brutal\n   death\n   of his younger brother Prince\n   \n    Oberyn\n   \n   at the hands of Ser Gregor, who also murdered their sister Princess\n   Elia\n   and her two young children, Princess\n   Rhaenys\n   and Prince\n   Aegon\n   . With Cersei declaring war against the Sands for their\n   murder\n   of her daughter Myrcella, Ellaria has turned to Daenerys and her loyalists to help bring down the Lannisters. Unknown to Ellaria, however, is that\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   , Myrcella's uncle, is now serving as Daenerys's\n   Hand of the Queen\n   , and will likely demand justice against the Sands for murdering his beloved niece in cold blood. Lady\n   \n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , herself now a target of Cersei as she is now the only surviving Tyrell, has met with Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, a meeting facilitated by\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   . Although skeptical of their motives (and wary that they essentially\n   murdered their own family\n   to seize power), grief-stricken and incensed by the deaths of her son, grandson, and granddaughter, Olenna pledges House Tyrell's forces to Daenerys in the hope of revenge for her slain family, no longer caring about her own survival.\n  \n\n   In the\n   \n    North\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   and Sansa Stark, aided by Ser\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Tormund Giantsbane\n   \n   , and Lady\n   \n    Lyanna Mormont\n   \n   , have finally defeated Ramsay Bolton and reclaimed Winterfell following a\n   \n    spectacular battle\n   \n   .

    "question": "who was House of Targaryen in Game of Thrones?",
    "response": "House Targaryen was the former royal house of Westeros in Game of Thrones, known for conquering and unifying the Seven Kingdoms under their rule. Originating from the ancient Valyrian Freehold, they fled to Dragonstone centuries before launching a devastating invasion led by Aegon I Targaryen, who used dragons to subdue six of the seven kingdoms, with Dorne joining later through marriage alliances. Their sigil is a red three-headed dragon on a black field, and their words are \"Fire and Blood,\" symbolizing their draconic heritage and fierce legacy.\n\nKey members and their impact include:\n- **Aegon I Targaryen**: The conqueror who established Targaryen rule, setting the foundation for their dynasty.\n- **Aerys II Targaryen (the Mad King)**: The last king before their fall, whose paranoia and tyranny sparked Robert's Rebellion.\n- **Rhaegar Targaryen**: His alleged kidnapping of Lyanna Stark ignited the rebellion, leading to the house's downfall.\n- **Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen**: The exiled survivors who attempted to reclaim the throne; Daenerys became a major character, using dragons to conquer and influence events across Essos and Westeros.\n- **Jon Snow (revealed as Aegon Targaryen)**: A secret Targaryen descendant, whose lineage tied into the series' themes of legacy and succession.\n\nThe house's fall came during Robert's Rebellion, where most Targaryens were killed, forcing Viserys and Daenerys into exile. Their legacy persisted through dragons, which Daenerys revived, and their bloodline influenced characters like Jon Snow. Despite their efforts, the Targaryens' story ended with Daenerys's death and Jon's exile, marking the end of their direct claim to power but leaving a lasting impact on the series' themes of power, madness, and rebirth.",

In the books, he was dubbed \"the Unlikely\" because he was the third son of\n   Maekar Targaryen\n   , who was in turn the fourth son of\n   Daeron II Targaryen\n   , and thus Aegon was highly unlikely to have inherited the crown.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Biography\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Background\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Season 1\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Season 4\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Season 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.5\n        \n\n         Season 8\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Family tree\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Behind the scenes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       In the books\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n         Potential adaptation\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       See also\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Biography\n   \n\n\n\n    Background\n   \n\n\n   As the youngest son of King Maekar and Queen\n   Dyanna\n   , Aegon was not originally expected to succeed his father to the throne, but after his older brother\n   Aerion\n   died, and his next older brother\n   \n    Aemon\n   \n   refused the throne due to his vows as a\n   \n    maester\n   \n   , the crown passed to him. Aemon then joined the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   to remove himself from the royal court, where he might be used as a political tool against his brother.\n  \n\n   Starting as a child, Aegon V began an odd friendship with the\n   hedge knight\n   Ser\n   Duncan the Tall\n   . He became Duncan's squire, and they had many adventures across Westeros. Eventually, after Aegon V came to the throne he named Ser Duncan to the\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   , and in time he became its\n   Lord Commander\n   . He later sent his army to deal with\n   Maelys Blackfyre\n   during the\n   War of the Ninepenny Kings\n   .\n  \n\n   After ruling for many years, Aegon V ultimately died along with Ser Duncan the Tall in the\n   Tragedy at Summerhall\n   when he attempted to hatch new\n   \n    dragon\n   \n   eggs using fire and sorcery. Instead, it caused a fire that spread out of control and destroyed the entire palace. Aegon V died in the conflagration, and was succeeded by his son\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   At\n   \n    Castle Black\n   \n   , Maester Aemon reveals to\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   that his father was Maekar, and after their father died the crown passed to his brother Aegon, because Aemon refused the throne due to his vows as a maester. He also bitterly recounts how his brother's\n   \n    son\n   \n   ,\n   \n    grandson\n   \n   ,\n   and\n   great-grandchildren\n   were all slaughtered during\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , making Snow realize that Aemon is a member of House Targaryen.\n   Unbeknownst to them both, Jon is also descended from Aegon, though Aemon would not live to learn the truth about Jon's parentage.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Aegon V is mentioned in\n   Duncan the Tall\n   's entry in\n   \n    The Book of Brothers\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Season 5\n   \n\n\n   On his deathbed, Aemon fondly compares\n   Little Sam\n   to Egg. Later, as his mind begins to slip, he calls out to Egg, and says he had a strange dream that he was an old man.\n  \n\n\n    Season 8\n   \n\n\n   Ser Duncan the Tall's deeds are recorded under his entry in\n   \n    The Book of Brothers\n   \n   , which the new Lord Commander of the Kingsguard\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   flicks through.

In the books, there were seventeen Targaryen kings that ruled the Seven Kingdoms, rather than the show having sixteen. After the death of Aegon V, his son Jaehaerys inherited the throne as Jaehaerys II and ruled for three years before dying of grief. After Jaehaerys's death, his son the Mad King took over as the last Targaryen king. This would make Aegon V the grandfather of the Mad King, the great-grandfather of Rhaegar, Viserys, and Daenerys Targaryen, and great-great-grandfather of Jon Snow.\n  \n\n   So far, it has not been confirmed in the series if Aegon V's daughter Rhaelle did marry into House Baratheon, giving the Baratheons their claim to the throne in the TV series as well as in the books, or if the entire progeny of Aegon V has been replaced with just Aerys and Rhaella. The\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   Viewer's Guide confirms the existence of\n   Duncan Targaryen\n   in the TV show (making him Aerys and Rhaella's brother instead of their uncle), though in the\n   Complete Guide to Westeros\n   video\n   \n    \"\n    House Baratheon\n    \"\n   \n   , Robert states that his claim to the throne was based on his descent from\n   Orys Baratheon\n   , said to be a half-brother of\n   Aegon I Targaryen\n   .\n  \n\n   Another issue that could arise due to the removal of Jaehaerys II is the Mad King's\n   insanity\n   . In the books, Aegon V married Betha of\n   House Blackwood\n   . If this turns out to be the case in the TV series, it would be a stretch to say that Aerys succumbed to insanity due to multiple generations of incest as he would then be descended from three Targaryens who married outside the family (though Aegon V's brother,\n   Aerion Brightflame\n   suffered from the madness despite being the issue of a marriage between a\n   \n    Targaryen\n   \n   and a\n   Dayne\n   as did their uncle\n   Rhaegel\n   despite being the issue of a marriage between a Targaryen and a\n   \n    Martell\n   \n   ). There remains a possibility that Aegon did have a sister he married in the TV continuity.\n  \n\n\n    In the books\n   \n\n\n   Aegon V Targaryen is a major character in\n   \n    George R.R. Martin\n   \n   's\n   \n\n     Tales of Dunk and Egg\n    \n\n   prequel novellas, which are set around ninety years before the events of\n   \n\n     A Song of Ice and Fire\n    \n\n   .\n  \n\n   Aegon, using the alias \"Egg\", spent many years traveling the Seven Kingdoms as a squire in the service of Ser\n   Duncan the Tall\n   , a hedge knight. At their first meeting Duncan was unaware of Egg's true identity, until he used his royal authority to save Duncan from being killed by his bullying older brother, Prince Aerion. Duncan was able to instead face Aerion on the\n   tournament\n   field and defeat him in combat. Unfortunately, Prince\n   Baelor \"Breakspear\" Targaryen\n   , the royal heir, was killed during the tournament. Prince\n   Maekar\n   - Aegon's father - despaired of Aerion's spoiled indolence and agreed to let Aegon serve as Duncan's sq \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Rhaenys Targaryen\n    \n\n\n      Season(s)\n     \n\n      3\n      ,\n      4\n     \n\n\n\n      Mentioned in\n     \n\n      \"\n      The Sack of King's Landing\n      \"\n      \"\n      House Clegane\n      \"\n      \"\n      \n       And Now His Watch Is Ended\n      \n      \"\n      \"\n      \n       Two Swords\n      \n      \"\n      \"\n      \n       Breaker of Chains\n      \n      \"\n      \"\n      \n       Mockingbird\n      \n      \"\n      \"\n      \n       The Mountain and the Viper\n      \n      \"\n      \"\n      House Martell\n      \"\n      \"\n      Robert's Rebellion\n      \"\n      \"\n      The Last Dragons\n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Titles\n     \n\n      Princess\n     \n\n\n\n      Status\n     \n\n\n\n      Age\n     \n\n      2 at death\n     \n\n\n\n      Date of birth\n     \n\n      278 AC\n     \n\n\n\n      Death\n     \n\n      280 AC\n      at\n      \n       King's Landing\n      \n      Killed during the\n      \n       Sack of King's Landing\n      \n      by\n      \n       Ser\n      \n\n       Gregor Clegane\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Origin\n     \n\n\n       King's Landing\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Allegiance\n     \n\n\n       House Targaryen\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Culture\n     \n\n\n       Valyrian\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Father\n     \n\n      {\n      \n       Rhaegar Targaryen\n      \n      }\n     \n\n\n\n      Mother\n     \n\n      {\n      Elia Martell\n      }\n     \n\n\n\n      Siblings\n     \n\n      {\n      \n       Aegon Targaryen\n      \n      }\n      \n\n\n        Jon Snow\n       \n\n        (paternal half-brother)\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Princess\n   \n    Rhaenys Targaryen\n   \n   was the daughter of Prince\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and Princess\n   Elia Martell\n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Biography\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.1\n        \n\n         Background\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.2\n        \n\n         Season 3\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.3\n        \n\n         Season 4\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         1.4\n        \n\n         Season 8\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Family tree\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.1\n        \n\n         Paternal\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.2\n        \n\n         Maternal\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       In the books\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       See also\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Biography\n   \n\n\n\n    Background\n   \n\n\n   Rhaenys Targaryen was the daughter of Prince\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and Princess\n   Elia Martell\n   . She had a younger full-brother,\n   \n    Aegon\n   \n   , and a younger paternal half-brother, who was also named Aegon but was raised as\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   .\n   For mysterious reasons, Rhaegar allegedly\n   abducted\n   Jon's mother,\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , sparking a\n   \n    rebellion\n   \n   that ultimately deposed\n   \n    House Targaryen\n   \n   as the ruling house of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   . Rhaegar was killed by\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , who was Lyanna's betrothed, at the\n   \n    Battle of the Trident\n   \n   . Soon afterwards, Rhaenys and Aegon were brutally murdered along with their mother by Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Thoros\n   \n   of Myr reminisces how he witnessed Gregor Clegane presenting the bodies of Aegon and Rhaenys before the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Rhaenys is mentioned many times, along with her mother and brother, by her maternal uncle\n   \n    Oberyn Martell\n   \n   , who makes it quite clear that he wants justice for their deaths.\n   He gets his chance to confront Ser Gregor when\n   \n    Tyrion\n   \n   demands a\n   trial by combat\n   to prove he is innocent of\n   \n    Joffrey's death\n   \n   . Oberyn volunteers to be Tyrion's champion after learning that Ser Gregor will be fighting for the crown.\n  \n\n   During the duel, Oberyn repeatedly reminds the Mountain of the crime he committed against House Martell, saying, \"You raped my sister, you murdered her, you killed her children.\" Oberyn initially gains the upper hand and proceeds to slowly cut down the Mountain all the while shouting in an ever louder voice, \"You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!\". However, Oberyn is unexpectedly caught off guard when the Mountain suddenly trips him up.

She was three- or four-years-old when she died, and took after her mother in appearance with the classic Dornish features of black hair, dark eyes, and olive skin (much to the distaste of her paternal grandfather, who often made snide racist remarks about Rhaenys and her mother).\n  \n\n   Rhaenys had a small black\n   kitten\n   she named \"\n   Balerion\n   \", after the mighty dragon of\n   Aegon the Conqueror\n   .\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   commented about it sadly, \"Rhaenys liked to pretend he was the true Balerion, the Black Dread of old, but I imagine the Lannisters taught her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough, the day they broke down her door.\" No one knows what happened to the cat after she died: it is implied that it survived the downfall of the Targaryens and lived out the next fifteen years in the Red Keep during the reign of Robert Baratheon. When\n   \n    Arya\n   \n   is ordered by\n   Syrio Forel\n   to chase cats around the Red Keep to train her in agility (which occurs in the TV series in \"\n   \n    Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things\n   \n   \") one of the cats she encounters is an incredibly old black cat with a chewed ear, who is mean to the entire Baratheon household, as well as the Lannisters. Once, when Tywin was visiting the Red Keep for a feast, the black cat jumped onto the table and snatched a roast quail right out of Tywin's fingers. According to Cersei, that cat attacks ravens at the rookery, and once clawed Joffrey's hand. This may very well be Rhaenys's cat Balerion, angered at the new residents of the castle who are responsible for the death of his original owner.\n   \n    George R.R. Martin\n   \n   was asked whether the aforementioned cat is Rhaenys's; he answered evasively \"Could be\".\n  \n\n   After King's Landing was seized by the Lannister forces, Rhaenys was found by Ser\n   \n    Amory Lorch\n   \n   hiding under the bed of her father, Rhaegar. While Gregor killed her mother and brother, Lorch killed Rhaenys by stabbing her about fifty times. When Robert arrived in the capital her body was presented at his feet, and it looked nearly hacked to pieces. Even Tywin considered that deed overly brutal (not the murder itself, but the manner in which it was done). He asked Lorch why killing a two- or three-year-old girl required so many thrusts, and Lorch answered that she kicked him and would not stop screaming. Years later, when discussing the event with Tyrion, Tywin disdainfully comments that if Lorch had \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           SPOILER WARNING\n          \n\n\n\n\n        This article includes content relating to the Dance of the Dragons, and therefore contains\n        \n         potential\n        \n        spoilers for\n        \n\n\n\n            House of the Dragon\n           \n\n\n\n        , as revealed in GRRM's writings.

After the obliteration of Valyria in the Doom, the Targaryens launched a devastating invasion of Westeros using three\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   to spearhead their attack. In a short period of time, six of the seven formerly independent kingdoms had surrendered to the Targaryen leader, King\n   \n    Aegon I\n   \n   , unifying the continent under his rule. The last hold-out,\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   , joined the kingdom through a political and marriage alliance some two centuries later.\n  \n\n   During the increasingly erratic reign of King\n   \n    Aerys II\n   \n   , his son\n   \n    Rhaegar\n   \n   was said to have\n   kidnapped\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   of\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   for unknown reasons. When Lyanna's brother\n   \n    Brandon\n   \n   protested, Aerys responded by having both him and his father\n   \n    Rickard Stark\n   \n   arrested and\n   executed.\n   This sparked a\n   \n    massive uprising\n   \n   led by\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Jon Arryn\n   \n   . At the end of this war, Aerys and Rhaegar were dead and the Targaryen power-base in Westeros destroyed. Aerys's youngest children,\n   \n    Viserys\n   \n   and\n   \n    Daenerys\n   \n   , were taken by Targaryen loyalists into exile in the\n   \n    Free Cities\n   \n   of the East. Unknown to most, however, Rhaegar had his marriage with\n   \n    Elia Martell\n   \n   annulled and remarried Lyanna, with whom he also had a son,\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   . As Lyanna lay dying after giving birth to her son, she pleaded with her brother Eddard to keep her baby safe from Robert, who surely would want her baby dead due to [Robert's] immense hatred for Rhaegar and promise to wipe out the Targaryen bloodline. She reveals her son's name is 'Aegon Targaryen'.\n   To protect his sister's son from Robert, Eddard takes his infant nephew back with him to\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , names him 'Jon',\n   and claims him as his illegitimate son, raising Jon as his own child alongside his trueborn children.\n   The child would become Jon Snow and grows up with the maternal side of his family.\n  \n\n   Generations of compound inbreeding have preserved in the Targaryen bloodline the classic Valyrian features of silver-white (platinum blonde) hair, and very fair, pale skin. Allegedly, this also preserved in their bloodline the ability to successfully bond with and ride dragons. They also seem to be somewhat more tolerant of extreme heat and high temperatures than other people, though they are by no means invulnerable to fire – or at least, not all of them. Unfortunately, some believe that this practice of inbreeding has also caused the trait of insanity to plague House Targaryen; though some members are known to be perfectly normal psychologically-speaking, other Targaryens throughout history have displayed bizarre, erratic and sometimes violent behavior, succumbing to the so-called '\n   Targaryen madness\n   '.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Viserys Targaryen\n   \n   arranges for the marriage of his sister\n   \n    Daenerys\n   \n   to the powerful\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n\n    Khal\n   \n\n    Drogo\n   \n   in exchange for a promise that Drogo will help him to reclaim his crown. Viserys treats Daenerys with contempt, strips her naked, and tells her that he would even let the horses have her if it meant that he could gain his crown.\n  \n\n   The marriage was brokered by\n   \n    Illyrio Mopatis\n   \n   , a magister of\n   \n    Pentos\n   \n   . Illyrio gives Daenerys a trio of ancient fossilized dragon eggs as a gift.\n   Daenerys comes to love both Drogo and his people while Viserys is increasingly frustrated by Drogo's failure to deliver on his promise.\n   Daenerys becomes pregnant with Drogo's son, who she names\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   , and he is prophesied to be the \"Stallion that mounts the world.\" Frustrated by the acceptance of Daenerys by the Dothraki, Viserys drunkenly threatens her unborn child and demands his crown.

    "question": "Who creat the game of thrones universe? ",
    "response": "The Game of Thrones universe was created by George R.R. Martin, an American author and novelist. He developed the intricate world of Westeros, including elements like the Iron Throne, through his epic fantasy book series titled \"A Song of Ice and Fire,\" which began with the first novel, \"A Game of Thrones,\" published in 1996. Martin's work forms the foundation of the entire narrative, including its complex characters, political intrigue, and lore, which was later adapted into the HBO television series. Learning about Martin can deepen your appreciation of the series' origins and help you explore the books for more detailed backstory.",

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     The North Remembers\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Season 2\n        \n\n         Episode 1\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Airdate\n     \n\n      April 1, 2012\n     \n\n\n\n      Runtime\n     \n\n      53 minutes\n     \n\n\n\n      Written by\n     \n\n\n       David Benioff\n      \n      &\n      \n       D.B.

Sansa convinces Joffrey to instead make Dontos his\n   court fool\n   , for which Dontos is grateful.\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   arrives back in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , to Joffrey's disdain, but to the delight of\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Myrcella\n   \n   who had worried that he was dead.\n  \n\n   The\n   \n    small council\n   \n   is in session to discuss the\n   Conclave\n   's announcement that the long summer has ended. Cersei orders the city gates closed to refugees from the\n   \n    war in the Riverlands\n   \n   . When Tyrion arrives with a letter from Lord Tywin, appointing him as acting\n   \n    Hand of the King\n   \n   in Tywin's stead, Cersei becomes livid. She is suspicious that Tyrion is taking power for himself, but he convinces her that he is there to act as an advisor. He criticizes his sister for failing to rein in Joffrey and overseeing numerous bad decisions, particularly the\n   \n    execution\n   \n   of\n   \n    Ned Stark\n   \n   . Their actions have sparked a war, which, he adds, their side is currently losing. He is even more incredulous when he learns that\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   escaped, pointing out how much stronger their position could have been with three Stark\n   hostages\n   . Tyrion hides his lover\n   \n    Shae\n   \n   in his chambers in the\n   Tower of the Hand\n   because he was forbidden by his father to bring her with him. She is initially thrilled at being brought to the capital, and says that big cities make her \"want to fuck\".\n  \n\n   Cersei tasks\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   with finding Arya. She needles Petyr about his unrequited love for Catelyn and he counters by referencing her relationship with Jaime, telling her that knowledge is power. She responds by threatening his life in a demonstration of her control over her guards, ordering them to first seize Baelish and cut his throat and almost immediately rescinding the order. She warns him that power is power.\n  \n\n   Joffrey redecorates his throne room, hoping to restore the intimidating grandeur it held under the\n   \n    Targaryens\n   \n   . He refuses his mother's suggestion that they ask\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   for aid in the search for Arya because he does not feel it is necessary to find her and does not feel it is fitting for a king to ask for help. He blames Tywin for their losses in the war and the capture of Jaime. Having heard rumors about his parentage, he confronts his mother. She dismisses it as gossip spread by his enemies. He questions her about\n   \n    his father\n   \n   's\n   \n    bastard\n   \n   children and insults her by saying that Robert had grown tired of her. She slaps him, and he warns her never to hit him again under threat of death.\n  \n\n   Lord\n   \n    Janos Slynt\n   \n   leads a city-wide\n   massacre\n   of Robert's bastards. The infant\n   Barra\n   is killed in Petyr's brothel in front of\n   her mother\n   and the\n   \n    prostitute\n   \n\n    Ros\n   \n   .\n   Tobho Mott\n   is interrogated and reveals that\n   \n    Gendry\n   \n   has left the city as a recruit of the Night's Watch. He says that Gendry can be identified by his bull's head helm. Gendry and Arya are travelling north on the\n   \n    Kingsroad\n   \n   with\n   \n    Yoren\n   \n   's recruits.\n  \n\n\n    At Winterfell\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Bran Stark\n   \n   suffers through the petty complaints of his vassals, facing unrest at\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   calling his banners and taking the young men south.\n   \n    Maester\n   \n\n    Luwin\n   \n   guides him in carrying out a lord's duties. Bran dreams that he is his\n   \n    direwolf\n   \n\n    Summer\n   \n   walking in the\n   \n    Godswood\n   \n   , and when he looks in the pool, he sees Summer's reflection rather than his own, which wakes him. He has\n   \n    Osha\n   \n   and\n   \n    Hodor\n   \n   take him to the pool and is reassured to find that his waking reflection is his own. They discuss the phenomenon of the\n   Red Comet\n   , as many people think it means different things. Osha tells him she believes it signifies the return of\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   to the world.\n  \n\n\n    On Dragonstone\n   \n\n\n   On the island of\n   \n    Dragonstone\n   \n   , King\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   allows his advisor\n   \n    Melisandre\n   \n   to burn statues of the gods of the\n   \n    Faith of the Seven\n   \n   as an offering to her deity the\n   \n    Lord of Light\n   \n   . Maester\n   Cressen\n   is outraged at the affront to his gods and fearful that Melisandre is leading Stannis into a war that he cannot win. Melisandre proclaims Stannis a champion of the Lord of Light, as he draws a\n   burning sword\n   from one of the statues. Cressen asks\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   to help him intervene but Davos says that it is not the right time.\n  \n\n   Stannis has received\n   \n    Ned Stark\n   \n   's letter, informing him that he was the true heir of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , so he will send copies of a letter announcing his claim to the throne of the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   to Lords throughout the realm. He details the incestuous relationship between\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   and challenges Joffrey's legitimacy.

To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n

War of the Five Kings\n   \n   , also known as the\n   \n    War of Five Kings\n   \n   , was a major multi-theater civil war in the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   of\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   that erupted in the wake of the death of\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Robert I\n   \n   . In essence, the war was a three-way battle for the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   fought alongside two independence movements.

Martin's agent. Initially sceptical of the fantasy genre, Benioff became a big fan of the books and invited his friend D.B. Weiss to develop the project with him for a screen adaptation. They initially considered a movie adaption, but realized this would mean losing most of the plot and characters from the books. Instead, they began working on an adaptation for television. They met with George R.R. Martin and spent several hours discussing the project. Martin was impressed with their enthusiasm and that they had already worked out the resolutions to several key mysteries in the books. He agreed with them that the series was a good fit for the cable company HBO, which Martin was already a big fan of.\n  \n\n   HBO agreed to option the project in 2007 and active development of a pilot script began. However, this was delayed by the\n   2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike\n   . In October 2008 HBO exercised its option to buy the rights to the series and ordered a pilot episode a few weeks later. Casting announcements were made throughout 2009, with\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   the first actor formally announced for the series. The pilot episode was filmed in Northern Ireland and Morocco in October and November 2009.\n  \n\n   HBO officially greenlit the series on 2 March 2010. Filming of\n   \n    Season 1\n   \n   began on 23 July, with Malta replacing Morocco for overseas filming. Several actors from the pilot were recast, requiring the re-filming of most of the first episode. The season wrapped filming on 15 December. HBO later confirmed that the first season had a budget of $60 million. The first season aired on HBO on 17 April-19 June 2011, garnering critical acclaim and steadily rising ratings. HBO confirmed after the transmission of the first episode that a second season had been commissioned.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 2 began on 25 July 2011 and wrapped on 12 December. Malta was dropped as a filming location, replaced by Croatia, while additional filming took place in Iceland. The budget for Season 2 was 15% higher than Season 1, necessitated by the addition more ambitious effects sequences and the use of CGI creatures such as\n   \n    direwolves\n   \n   and\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   . The second season aired from 1 April to 3 June 2012, garnering additional critical acclaim and increased ratings. By the end of the second season, the show had become the third-most-successful series in HBO's history, behind only\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   and\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   . In addition, the DVD and Blu-ray set of Season 1 was released just prior to transmission of Season 2 and immediately became HBO's fastest-selling media release in its history.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 3 began on 10 July 2012 and wrapped on 24 November. Morocco was added to the filming roster alongside Croatia, Iceland and Northern Ireland, with the complexities of filming requiring the addition of a third filming unit to the existing two. An additional scene was shot in Los Angeles for safety reasons, meaning that Season 3 was filmed in five separate countries on three continents. The season aired from 31 March to 2 June 2013. The penultimate episode\n   \n\n     The Rains of Castamere\n    \n\n   won widespread critical acclaim for its shock twist ending. By the end of the season the show had supplanted\n   \n    True Blood\n   \n   as the second-most successful HBO show in the United States and\n   \n    The Sopranos\n   \n   as its most successful series worldwide.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 4 began on 8 July 2013 and concluded on 21 November. Production was more focused this season, with only two units used and filming restricted to Northern Ireland, Iceland and Croatia. This was to allow more of the budget to be concentrated on several major action and effects sequences late in the season.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 5 ran from 18 July 2014 to 12 December. Production was focused once more, with two units filming in Northern Ireland, Croatia and Spain, with Spain being a new addition to the show's shooting countries.\n  \n\n   Production of Season 6 ran from mid-July 2015 to 17 December. Filming took place in Northern Ireland and Spain, while the production only returned to Croatia for a brief shoot, as they used several locations in Spain as exterior sets for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Braavos\n   \n   and\n   \n    Meereen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Production of Season 7 ran from 31 August 2016 to February 2017, which was later than past seasons, mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros, and will be shortened to seven episodes, due to the smaller amount of story content remaining, as well as the increased production values and time required to film episodes involving larger set pieces. Filming took place in Northern Ireland, Spain, Iceland and, once again briefly, Croatia.\n  \n\n\n    Adaptation process and catching up with the books\n   \n\n\n\n    Seasons 1-4:\n    \n     A Game of Thrones\n    \n    ,\n    \n     A Clash of Kings\n    \n    &\n    \n     A Storm of Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   As of 2016, five books have been published in the\n   \n    A Song of Ice and Fire\n   \n   series, and author George R.R.

    "question": "who is the protagonist of the show? ",
    "response": "In \"Game of Thrones,\" there isn't a single protagonist because it's an ensemble show with multiple central characters, each driving different storylines across the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. This structure reflects the complexity of George R.R. Martin's world, where the narrative shifts between various perspectives to explore themes like power, loyalty, and survival. Based on the context, key figures often considered central include:\n\n- **Jon Snow**: A prominent character from the Night's Watch storyline, involved in expeditions beyond the Wall and personal growth arcs.\n- **Daenerys Targaryen**: A strong leader and claimant to the Iron Throne, whose journey with her dragons and quest for power makes her a focal point.\n- **Tyrion Lannister**: Known for his wit and strategic role in King's Landing, he appears in all episodes of Season 2 and is a fan-favorite due to his complex development.\n\nThis ensemble approach means no one character is the sole \"hero,\" but these individuals play significant roles in advancing the plot and themes. To better comprehend the story, focus on how their paths intersect and evolve throughout the series.",

His parents were Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin, who also had two daughters, George's sisters Darleen and Janet. The family was of mixed Irish and Italian heritage. Raymond worked as a longshoreman, and the family lived in a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks. The family followed Roman Catholicism, and at the age of 13 George received the confirmation name \"Richard\", hence \"George Raymond Richard Martin\" (in later years, when working on the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series, George has described himself as a \"\n   lapsed Catholic\n   \").\n  \n\n   He became an avid fan of comic books while in high school:\n   \n    Fantastic Four\n   \n   #20 (November 1963) contains a letter he wrote to the editor. He subsequently became involved in the comic book fanzine scene, and attended the very first Comi-Con convention in New York City. In his youth he also became a fan of science fiction and fantasy literature, such as the works of Robert Heinlein, Robert E. Howard, Jack Vance and J.R.R. Tolkien. After college he held jobs as a journalist, chess tournament organizer and English teacher at a Christian women's college. He was married briefly in the mid-1970s, and has lived with his partner Parris in Santa Fe since 1981. They married in January 2011.\n  \n\n   Martin has chosen a turtle as his personal sigil, and he is often seen wearing a hat with a turtle pin on it. As Martin himself explained at the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   panel for San Diego Comic Con 2012:\n  \n\n   As he also explained in an interview with\n   \n    Financial Times\n   \n   :\n  \n\n\n    Short fiction\n   \n\n\n   Martin began writing his first short fiction in the late 1960s, but wasn't published professionally until 1971. A lot of Martin's early work was set in the 'Thousand Worlds', an SF backdrop set millennia into the future where humanity has slowly spread into space and encountered other races. His 1973 story from this setting,\n   \n    A Song for Lya\n   \n   , won Martin his first Hugo Award. In 1980 he achieved significant acclaim when\n   \n    Sandkings\n   \n   won both the Hugo and the Nebula for Best Novelette and\n   \n    The Way of Cross and Dragon\n   \n   won the Hugo for Best Short Story.\n   \n    Sandkings\n   \n   was for many years his best-known story and was adapted for television as the pilot episode of the new\n   \n    Outer Limits\n   \n   in 1996.\n  \n\n\n    Novels\n   \n\n\n   Martin moved into novel-length fiction with\n   \n    Dying of the Light\n   \n   , a sci-fi novel set in the Thousand Worlds milieu. It was published in 1977 and was nominated for a Hugo the following year. He followed up on this book with\n   \n    Windhaven\n   \n   in 1981, co-written with Lisa Tuttle. In 1982 he achieved significant critical and commercial success with\n   \n    Fevre Dream\n   \n   , a vampire novel set on the Mississippi around the time of the American Civil War which was nominated for the World Fantasy Award. His publishers eagerly signed up his follow-up,\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   , about a rock band whose comeback tour has supernatural overtones, but the book was a commercial failure, despite critical acclaim and a second World Fantasy Award nomination. Although Martin successfully sold a collection of his Thousand World stories featuring the character of Haviland Tuf as\n   \n    Tuf Voyaging\n   \n   , his novel career seemed to have stalled at that point.\n  \n\n\n    Hollywood\n   \n\n\n   The failure of\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   had a significant impact on Martin's fortunes, and there was little excitement over his next novel-in-progress,\n   \n    Black and White and Red All Over\n   \n   . However, television producer Phil DeGuere was impressed enough by\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   to option it as a movie script, and in 1985 asked Martin to contribute to a new project he was developing for CBS,\n   \n    The New Twilight Zone\n   \n   . Martin, although a huge fan of the original Rod Serling series, was hesitant to enter the competitive field of scriptwriting, but was convinced by the involvement of another writer he respected enormously, Harlan Ellison, as well as DeGuere's promise of backstage passes to Grateful Dead concerts. When Ellison abruptly left the series due to creative clashes, Martin was brought in as a staff writer. When the show unexpectedly returned for a second season, Martin was bumped up to story editor, but the series was then taken off the air for \"retooling\" for its third season.\n  \n\n   George R.R. Martin was not involved in the third season as Ron Koslow, a fan of his\n   \n    Twilight Zone\n   \n   work, had recruited him to be involved in his new urban fantasy series,\n   \n    Beauty and the Beast\n   \n   , starring Linda Hamilton, Ron Perlman and\n   Roy Dotrice\n   . Martin started as Executive Story Consultant and ended up as Supervising Producer on the third and final season. During his time on the show, he gained a reputation for being unafraid to kill off major characters (to fan's ire) and for showing the darker side of humanity. After the show ended, Martin had gained enough Hollywood credentials to attempt to launch his own show,\n   \n    Doorways\n   \n   , which eventually had a pilot produced by ABC in 1992. The pilot was never screened and the show never made, although a later series,\n   \n    Sliders\n   \n   , explored similar ideas.\n  \n\n\n    Roleplaying and\n    \n     Wild Cards\n    \n\n\n\n   Martin's first involvement with roleplaying games came when Scottish science fiction and fantasy writer Charles Stross 'borrowed' the githzerai and githyanki from his Thousand Worlds setting to use as\n   \n    Dungeons and Dragons\n   \n   monsters in an article for\n   \n    Dragon Magazine\n   \n   . They proved popular and have remained a D&D mainstay ever since, although Martin was unaware of the homage until many years later.\n  \n\n   Martin himself was introduced to roleplaying games in the late 1970s by Parris. His first game was\n   \n    Call of Cthulhu\n   \n   by Chaosium, and he was soon running his own game. However, he put this to one side when he was introduced to\n   \n    SuperWorlds\n   \n   by Victor Milán. His gaming group became enamored of the game and setting, and Martin eventually hit on the idea of developing their campaign into a shared-world anthology series. This idea proved successful, since such anthology series were all the rage in the mid-1980s thanks to the success of Lynn Abbey and Robert Asprin's\n   \n    Thieves World\n   \n   series, and Martin further enhanced the book by calling in experienced writers such as Roger Zelazny and Howard Waldrop to help expand it.\n   \n    Wild Cards\n   \n   was released in 1986 and was an immediate hit, and was succeeded by fourteen further books in the series, released over the next nine years.

Robb decides that he must win the allegiance of the fiercely independent\n   \n    ironborn\n   \n   to his cause, and sends his best friend\n   \n    Theon Greyjoy\n   \n   to treat with\n   \n    his father\n   \n   , who is hatching plans of his own. Meanwhile,\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   holds the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   with the backing of the powerful\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   , but his uncle\n   \n    Renly\n   \n   has also claimed the throne with the support of\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   , whose armies are much larger. As they struggle for the throne,\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   arrives in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   to take matters in hand, only to face opposition from his scheming sister,\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   , now the Queen Regent.\n  \n\n   However, there is another faction entering the picture.\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   , Robert's younger brother and Renly's older brother, has also claimed the Iron Throne. A proven battle commander and veteran of\n   \n    several\n   \n\n    wars\n   \n   , Stannis is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies and will do what is right even if it destroys him. Advising him is\n   \n    Melisandre\n   \n   , an enigmatic\n   \n    priestess\n   \n   from the east, who believes Stannis is meant for a\n   greater destiny\n   , and Ser\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   , an honest and honorable man uneasy with the shifts in power at Stannis' court.\n  \n\n   Far to the east,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   has hatched the only three\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   in the world.

Tales of Dunk and Egg\n    \n\n   are a series of prequel novellas written by\n   \n    George R.R. Martin\n   \n   , which begin 90 years before the events of the\n   \n\n     A Song of Ice and Fire\n    \n\n   novels (on which the TV series\n   \n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   is based). They follow the adventures of Ser\n   Duncan the Tall\n   and his squire, Prince\n   \n    Aegon \"Egg\" Targaryen\n   \n   who is the younger brother of Maester\n   \n    Aemon\n   \n   . Though Egg is a boy at the start of the series he will eventually grow up to become King Aegon V, or \"Aegon the Unlikely\".\n  \n\n   The\n   \n    Tales of Dunk and Egg\n   \n   may potentially be made into a live-action project which will be a prequel to the main\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series.

The realm is still recovering from the First\n   Blackfyre Rebellion\n   thirteen years before, a great civil war that tore the Seven Kingdoms in half. Daeron II's bastard half-brother\n   Daemon I Blackfyre\n   had tried to seize the\n   \n    throne\n   \n   in the rebellion, but was killed in the final battle of the war. Several of his sons survived by fleeing into exile, and across the\n   \n    Narrow Sea\n   \n   ,\n   House Blackfyre\n   is continually plotting all manner of intrigues against the main branch of the\n   \n    Targaryen dynasty\n   \n   , hoping to gain support for new rebellions.\n  \n\n   The Targaryens are still having difficulty maintaining their hold on power, particularly since the last of their\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   died fifty years ago, and the beasts are starting to fade from living memory. There are also lingering tensions from the recent unification of\n   \n    Dorne\n   \n   with the rest of the Seven Kingdoms. The fiercely independent\n   \n    Dornishmen\n   \n   had resisted Targaryen conquest for two centuries, and only finally came under the authority of the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   through peaceful marriage-alliance. Daeron II married the sister of the Prince of Dorne, and Daeron II's sister married the Prince of Dorne. The terms of the alliance led to the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   giving\n   \n    House Martell\n   \n   of Dorne preferential treatment, with a strong pro-Martell faction developing around Daeron II at the royal court. This is one of the factors that sparked the Blackfyre Rebellion, as all of the non-Dornish lords who felt that the pro-Martell faction was receiving royal favors which should have been theirs ultimately sided with Daemon Blackfyre. Despite thirteen years of relative peace, relations between the Dornish and the rest of the Seven Kingdoms remain tenuous.\n  \n\n   Worse problems are on the horizon, as during the course of Dunk and Egg's first adventures a massive plague known as the\n   Great Spring Sickness\n   sweeps across the Seven Kingdoms (\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   's equivalent of the\n   Black Death\n   ), upsetting what was already a fragile political balance. With plague and drought devastating the Seven Kingdoms, many turn to banditry to survive, and the roads are crawling with outlaw bands. Petty feuds erupt between local lords competing over food and resources. With the realm weakened from within, dangers arise on every side, as the Targaryens' enemies see their vulnerable state as a perfect opportunity to attack. Besides the continuing tensions with the Dornish to the south, the Blackfyres across the eastern sea are attempting to raise new armies in the\n   \n    Free Cities\n   \n   , and to turn lords in Westeros to their side who are upset at the difficulties the Targaryen reign is encountering. To the west, the\n   \n    ironborn\n   \n   led by Dagon Greyjoy are seizing their best chance in generations to return to the Old Way, conducting brazen coastal raids from\n   \n    Bear Island\n   \n   in the North to the\n   \n    Arbor\n   \n   in the south. To the north the\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   have been united by a new\n   \n    King-Beyond-the-Wall\n   \n   ,\n   Raymun Redbeard\n   , and they are preparing to cross over the Wall and sweep through the lands to the south.\n  \n\n   Into this backdrop steps Ser\n   Duncan the Tall\n   , a very large squire who grew up as an orphan in the slums of\n   Flea Bottom\n   in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . After the hedge knight he is in service to dies while heading to a tournament, Dunk takes his gear and enters the tournament as a knight himself. Along the way he strikes up an odd friendship with a young boy who turns out to be Prince Aegon Targaryen, commonly known by his nickname \"Egg\", a grandson of King Daeron II. Later, however, he runs afoul of Aegon's sadistic and arrogant older brother, Prince\n   Aerion Brighflame\n   , after Aerion accosts\n   a beautiful Dornish woman\n   with whom Duncan becomes smitten. Through a series of many adventures the unlikely duo of \"Dunk and Egg\" will, in the course of years, rise to great fame, as Egg grows to become King Aegon V, and Dunk becomes Ser Duncan the Tall, Lord Commander of the\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Martin has said that the novellas will include time-jumps so that they will ultimately cover the rest of the lives of the two main characters, stretching across a period of 50 years, until both of them die in the\n   Tragedy at Summerhall\n   . This will bridge the timeline between the two main narrative eras: Ser\n   \n    Barristan Selmy\n   \n   was knighted at the age of sixteen by King Aegon V after unhorsing Ser Duncan in a joust.\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   's grandfather Gerold Lannister is a character in the early novellas, but young Tywin was a boy when Aegon V died. Prince\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   was also born the very same night as the\n   Tragedy at Summerhall\n   .\n  \n\n\n    Potential adaptation\n   \n\n\n   On February 10, 2013, George R.R. Martin confirmed that he had been in discussion with\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   over a possible adaptation of the\n   \n    Tales of Dunk and Egg\n   \n   short stories, though in what format (TV movies, theatrical movie, or a spin-off TV series) was not made clear.\n  \n\n   The HBO production team from the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series has said that they dismiss out of hand the possibility of starting any prequel project before the main series if finished, given the massive amount of work involved on it. They physically cannot produce more than ten episodes on any Westeros-related project in a single year. While potential future prequel projects are being discussed, this is mostly legal negotiation at this point, and no pre-production work will be started until after the final season of\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Before the beginning of Season 5 of\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   , HBO programming president Michael Lombardo said in an interview with\n   \n    Entertainment Weekly\n   \n   that the network would eagerly accept the TV series going on for eight to ten seasons, but only if writers Benioff and Weiss felt it served the story instead of dragging it out.\n   This strongly indicates that HBO is interested in continuing to make Westeros-related projects for years to come, such as moving on to a\n   \n    Tales of Dunk and Egg\n   \n   prequel after the main series ends.\n  \n\n   The main\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series has made a few alterations to the overall TV continuity which will affect later seasons of any live-action\n   \n    Tales of Dunk and Egg\n   \n   TV series. In the novels,\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the \"Mad King\" overthrown in\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   - was Aegon V's\n   \n    grandson\n   \n   . In the novels, the Mad King's father was Jaehaerys II, Aegon V's eldest son. Jaehaerys II had notoriously poor health and died young after only ruling three years, but during that time he ruled well, and effectively dealt with the\n   War of the Ninepenny Kings\n   (the fifth and last\n   Blackfyre Rebellion\n   ). Season 1 of\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   , however, established that the Mad King is actually Egg's son, not his grandson, and the TV producers have confirmed that Jaehaerys II simply does not exist in the TV continuity. Possibly this means that Aegon V's other children (who are characters in the prequel era) have been omitted as well, though the full after-effects of removing an entire generation from the royal family are unknown.\n  \n\n   In the novels, the era of Aegon V's reign also saw the slow decline of\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   under Gerold's incompetent third son\n   \n    Tytos Lannister\n   \n   , whose hold on power in the\n   \n    Westerlands\n   \n   became so weak that Aegon V actually had to militarily intervene several times to restore order. The very end of the elderly Aegon V's reign, extending into Jaehaerys II's short reign, saw the rise of the young\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , ruthless, cunning, and capable in all of the ways his father was not. First rising to fame as a young warrior in the War of the Ninepenny Kings (not unlike the later\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   ), Tywin set about single-handedly rebuilding House Lannister from a laughingstock into the most powerful House in the Seven Kingdoms. During this span of decades the intense rivalry between the Lannisters and their upstart vassals\n   House Reyne\n   played out, culminating in the\n   Reyne Rebellion\n   , during which Tywin wiped out all of his rivals. Aerys II was so impressed with how Tywin crushed his enemies that he named him the new\n   \n    Hand of the King\n   \n   , a position he held for nearly twenty years - before resigning and later\n   \n    betraying\n   \n   Aerys II to his death in\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   The TV continuity removed Jaehaerys",

His parents were Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin, who also had two daughters, George's sisters Darleen and Janet. The family was of mixed Irish and Italian heritage. Raymond worked as a longshoreman, and the family lived in a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks. The family followed Roman Catholicism, and at the age of 13 George received the confirmation name \"Richard\", hence \"George Raymond Richard Martin\" (in later years, when working on the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series, George has described himself as a \"\n   lapsed Catholic\n   \").\n  \n\n   He became an avid fan of comic books while in high school:\n   \n    Fantastic Four\n   \n   #20 (November 1963) contains a letter he wrote to the editor. He subsequently became involved in the comic book fanzine scene, and attended the very first Comi-Con convention in New York City. In his youth he also became a fan of science fiction and fantasy literature, such as the works of Robert Heinlein, Robert E. Howard, Jack Vance and J.R.R. Tolkien. After college he held jobs as a journalist, chess tournament organizer and English teacher at a Christian women's college. He was married briefly in the mid-1970s, and has lived with his partner Parris in Santa Fe since 1981. They married in January 2011.\n  \n\n   Martin has chosen a turtle as his personal sigil, and he is often seen wearing a hat with a turtle pin on it. As Martin himself explained at the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   panel for San Diego Comic Con 2012:\n  \n\n   As he also explained in an interview with\n   \n    Financial Times\n   \n   :\n  \n\n\n    Short fiction\n   \n\n\n   Martin began writing his first short fiction in the late 1960s, but wasn't published professionally until 1971. A lot of Martin's early work was set in the 'Thousand Worlds', an SF backdrop set millennia into the future where humanity has slowly spread into space and encountered other races. His 1973 story from this setting,\n   \n    A Song for Lya\n   \n   , won Martin his first Hugo Award. In 1980 he achieved significant acclaim when\n   \n    Sandkings\n   \n   won both the Hugo and the Nebula for Best Novelette and\n   \n    The Way of Cross and Dragon\n   \n   won the Hugo for Best Short Story.\n   \n    Sandkings\n   \n   was for many years his best-known story and was adapted for television as the pilot episode of the new\n   \n    Outer Limits\n   \n   in 1996.\n  \n\n\n    Novels\n   \n\n\n   Martin moved into novel-length fiction with\n   \n    Dying of the Light\n   \n   , a sci-fi novel set in the Thousand Worlds milieu. It was published in 1977 and was nominated for a Hugo the following year. He followed up on this book with\n   \n    Windhaven\n   \n   in 1981, co-written with Lisa Tuttle. In 1982 he achieved significant critical and commercial success with\n   \n    Fevre Dream\n   \n   , a vampire novel set on the Mississippi around the time of the American Civil War which was nominated for the World Fantasy Award. His publishers eagerly signed up his follow-up,\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   , about a rock band whose comeback tour has supernatural overtones, but the book was a commercial failure, despite critical acclaim and a second World Fantasy Award nomination. Although Martin successfully sold a collection of his Thousand World stories featuring the character of Haviland Tuf as\n   \n    Tuf Voyaging\n   \n   , his novel career seemed to have stalled at that point.\n  \n\n\n    Hollywood\n   \n\n\n   The failure of\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   had a significant impact on Martin's fortunes, and there was little excitement over his next novel-in-progress,\n   \n    Black and White and Red All Over\n   \n   . However, television producer Phil DeGuere was impressed enough by\n   \n    The Armageddon Rag\n   \n   to option it as a movie script, and in 1985 asked Martin to contribute to a new project he was developing for CBS,\n   \n    The New Twilight Zone\n   \n   . Martin, although a huge fan of the original Rod Serling series, was hesitant to enter the competitive field of scriptwriting, but was convinced by the involvement of another writer he respected enormously, Harlan Ellison, as well as DeGuere's promise of backstage passes to Grateful Dead concerts. When Ellison abruptly left the series due to creative clashes, Martin was brought in as a staff writer. When the show unexpectedly returned for a second season, Martin was bumped up to story editor, but the series was then taken off the air for \"retooling\" for its third season.\n  \n\n   George R.R. Martin was not involved in the third season as Ron Koslow, a fan of his\n   \n    Twilight Zone\n   \n   work, had recruited him to be involved in his new urban fantasy series,\n   \n    Beauty and the Beast\n   \n   , starring Linda Hamilton, Ron Perlman and\n   Roy Dotrice\n   . Martin started as Executive Story Consultant and ended up as Supervising Producer on the third and final season. During his time on the show, he gained a reputation for being unafraid to kill off major characters (to fan's ire) and for showing the darker side of humanity. After the show ended, Martin had gained enough Hollywood credentials to attempt to launch his own show,\n   \n    Doorways\n   \n   , which eventually had a pilot produced by ABC in 1992. The pilot was never screened and the show never made, although a later series,\n   \n    Sliders\n   \n   , explored similar ideas.\n  \n\n\n    Roleplaying and\n    \n     Wild Cards\n    \n\n\n\n   Martin's first involvement with roleplaying games came when Scottish science fiction and fantasy writer Charles Stross 'borrowed' the githzerai and githyanki from his Thousand Worlds setting to use as\n   \n    Dungeons and Dragons\n   \n   monsters in an article for\n   \n    Dragon Magazine\n   \n   . They proved popular and have remained a D&D mainstay ever since, although Martin was unaware of the homage until many years later.\n  \n\n   Martin himself was introduced to roleplaying games in the late 1970s by Parris. His first game was\n   \n    Call of Cthulhu\n   \n   by Chaosium, and he was soon running his own game. However, he put this to one side when he was introduced to\n   \n    SuperWorlds\n   \n   by Victor Milán. His gaming group became enamored of the game and setting, and Martin eventually hit on the idea of developing their campaign into a shared-world anthology series. This idea proved successful, since such anthology series were all the rage in the mid-1980s thanks to the success of Lynn Abbey and Robert Asprin's\n   \n    Thieves World\n   \n   series, and Martin further enhanced the book by calling in experienced writers such as Roger Zelazny and Howard Waldrop to help expand it.\n   \n    Wild Cards\n   \n   was released in 1986 and was an immediate hit, and was succeeded by fourteen further books in the series, released over the next nine years. Despite very strong sales to start with, by the mid-1990s interest was  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Looking for more Telltale content?

The Forresters are a family of the minor nobility from the\n   Wolfswood\n   in the\n   \n    North\n   \n   , bannermen to\n   House Glover\n   - who are in turn themselves major vassals sworn to\n   \n    House Stark\n   \n   of\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   . The seat of House Forrester is\n   \n    Ironrath\n   \n   , an imposing stronghold in the forest surrounded by ironwood trees. Their\n   House words\n   are \"Iron from Ice\", echoing their belief that the severe cold and hostile landscape of the North only make them stronger.\n  \n\n   House Forrester's basic details and allegiances exist in the novels. However they were only mentioned in passing once and its current members were not described: \"\n   \n    ...guides Lady Sybell [Glover] had given them, trackers and hunters sworn to Deepwood with clan names like Forrester and Woods, Branch and Bole.\n   \n   \" (\n   \n    A Dance With Dragons\n   \n   , Chapter 42) With no details given about its current members in the novels, this gives the video game a blank canvas to fill new characters with.\n  \n\n   The events of the first season of the game series generally coincide with\n   \n    Season 4\n   \n   , beginning towards the end of\n   \n    Season 3\n   \n   and ending just before\n   \n    Season 5\n   \n   begins.\n  \n\n   Players visit familiar locations such as\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   , as well as unfamiliar locations such as Ironrath, the home of House Forrester. The game is played from five different points of view. Each character you play as is a member of House Forrester; either a direct family member or a person in service to the House. Scattered across Westeros and Essos, each character will play their part in seeking to save House Forrester from destruction. Playing as five characters not only reflects the epic scope of\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   , but is also something that the player needs to be mindful of. This is because the actions of one character can ripple out to affect the rest of House Forrester.\n  \n\n   Actors from the main\n   \n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   TV series reprised their roles for the video game, providing voice-acting for the in-game appearances of their characters, including\n   \n    Lena Headey\n   \n   (Cersei),\n   \n    Peter Dinklage\n   \n   (Tyrion),\n   \n    Natalie Dormer\n   \n   (Margaery), and\n   \n    Iwan Rheon\n   \n   (Ramsay). Other actors and characters from the main TV series were to appear in later episodes.\n  \n\n\n    Background\n   \n\n\n   In the\n   social structure\n   of the\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   , there are usually only nine\n   \n    Great Houses\n   \n   , such as the Starks or Lannisters, that rule entire regions (\"seven\" kingdoms, plus the\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   which are a borderland region, plus the capital region of the\n   \n    Crownlands\n   \n   ). Each Great House has about a dozen or so major noble Houses immediately sworn to them. In the North, these include\n   \n    House Umber\n   \n   ,\n   \n    House Manderly\n   \n   ,\n   \n    House Karstark\n   \n   , and\n   House Glover\n   , among others. All told this means that there are a little over one hundred major noble Houses in Westeros, almost all of which have been accounted for in the novels. However, each of the major noble Houses also have their own minor noble Houses that serve them as local bannermen. For example,\n   House Cassel\n   is a local minor House in direct service to the Starks, not one of the major noble Houses like the Umbers (\n   \n    George R.R. Martin\n   \n   has said that in retrospect, he should have used distinct terms for the three different ranks of nobles, such as \"duke\" and \"baron\", instead of each holding the rank of \"Lord\"). Given that each major noble House has a couple of minor Houses serving as local bannermen, there are apparently\n   \n    hundreds\n   \n   of minor Houses which have never been mentioned in the novels, with the main novel mostly focusing on the large-scale conflicts between entire kingdoms.\n  \n\n   Essentially, the video game is focusing on a representative \"everyman\" minor House, to show how the\n   War of the Five Kings\n   is impacting people on a local level.\n  \n\n   Westeros is a large continent (often said to be roughly the size of South America), not simply one country, so the unified realm under the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   is on the scale of the Roman Empire, and each constituent kingdom such as \"the North\" is the size of an entire real-life medieval country, with armies numbering in the tens of thousands. Major Houses such as the Umbers or Karstarks can raise armies from their combined minor bannermen numbering in the low thousands. Minor noble Houses who are bannermen to the others have forces numbering in the hundreds at most.\n  \n\n\n    Cancelled sequel\n   \n\n\n\n    Game of Thrones: A Telltale Game Series\n   \n   Season 2 is a cancelled episodic video game based on the\n   \n    HBO\n   \n   television series. It was being developed by Telltale Games, developers of Season 1 as well as other critically praised games such as\n   \n    The Walking Dead\n   \n   ,\n   \n    The Wolf Among Us\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tales From The Borderlands\n   \n   . It was announced on November 20, 2015 in an interview with Kevin Bruner, then Telltale's CEO and co-founder and executive producer of Season 1.\n  \n\n   In an interview with Eurogamer on August 29, 2017, Telltale's head of creative communications Job Stauffer stated that plans for Season 2 were on hold due the other games they are working on and because they want to see where the narrative of the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series goes. Job Stauffer said that the project was having a hold up at least until the\n   \n    Game of Thrones\n   \n   TV series ends with\n   Season 8\n   .\n  \n\n   On September 21, 2018 it was announced that Telltale Games was undergoing a studio closure which meant that multiple Telltale employees had been laid off with just 10% of the staff staying on to fulfill the company's obligations to its board and partners\".\n   The second season of\n   \n    Game of Thrones: A Telltale Game series\n   \n   , as well as all of Telltale's other in-development projects, were canceled upon the majority studio closure and eventual bankruptcy and collapse of Telltale Incorporated. The status of the game's canonicity in relation to the television series is uncertain.\n  \n\n\n    Voice cast\n   \n\n\n\n    TV series cast reprising their roles\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Lena Headey\n    \n    as Queen\n    \n     Cersei Lannister\n    \n\n     (episodes 1-6)\n    \n\n\n\n     Natalie Dormer\n    \n    as Lady\n    \n     Margaery Tyrell\n    \n\n     (episodes 1-6)\n    \n\n\n\n     Peter Dinklage\n    \n    as\n    \n     Tyrion Lannister\n    \n\n     (episodes 1-5)\n    \n\n\n\n     Iwan Rheon\n    \n    as\n    \n     Ramsay Snow\n    \n\n     (episodes 1-6)\n    \n\n\n\n     Kit Harington\n    \n    as\n    \n     Jon Snow\n    \n\n     (episodes 2-6)\n    \n\n\n\n     Emilia Clarke\n    \n    as Queen\n    \n     Daenerys Targaryen\n    \n\n     (episodes 3-6)\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Characters introduced in the video game\n   \n\n\n\n    Daniel Kendrick\n    as\n    Gared Tuttle\n    \n     (episodes 1-6)\n    \n\n\n    Martha Mackintosh\n    as\n    Mira Forrester\n    \n     (episodes 1-6)\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Game of Thrones\n     \n\n      Season 2\n     \n\n\n\n      Episodes\n     \n\n      10\n     \n\n\n\n      Premiere\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       The North Remembers\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Finale\n     \n\n      \"\n      \n       Valar Morghulis\n      \n      \"\n     \n\n\n\n      Transmission dates\n     \n\n      April 1, 2012 to\n      June 3, 2012\n     \n\n\n\n      Production dates\n     \n\n      July 25, 2011 to\n      December 12, 2011\n     \n\n\n\n      DVD/Blu-ray\n     \n\n      February 19, 2013\n     \n\n\n     Episode guide\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Previous\n        \n\n         Next\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Season 1\n         \n\n\n\n          Season 3\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The\n   \n    second season\n   \n   of\n   \n\n     Game of Thrones\n    \n\n   consists of ten episodes and began filming on July 25, 2011 and wrapped on December 12, 2011.

The\n   \n    Seven Kingdoms\n   \n   are at war, with the\n   \n\n     King in the North\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , fighting to win independence for his people and those of the\n   \n    Riverlands\n   \n   . Robb decides that he must win the allegiance of the fiercely independent\n   \n    ironborn\n   \n   to his cause, and sends his best friend\n   \n    Theon Greyjoy\n   \n   to treat with\n   \n    his father\n   \n   , who is hatching plans of his own. Meanwhile,\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   holds the\n   \n    Iron Throne\n   \n   with the backing of the powerful\n   \n    House Lannister\n   \n   , but his uncle\n   \n    Renly\n   \n   has also claimed the throne with the support of\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   , whose armies are much larger. As they struggle for the throne,\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   arrives in\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   to take matters in hand, only to face opposition from his scheming sister,\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   , now the Queen Regent.\n  \n\n   However, there is another faction entering the picture.\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   , Robert's younger brother and Renly's older brother, has also claimed the Iron Throne. A proven battle commander and veteran of\n   \n    several\n   \n\n    wars\n   \n   , Stannis is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies and will do what is right even if it destroys him. Advising him is\n   \n    Melisandre\n   \n   , an enigmatic\n   \n    priestess\n   \n   from the east, who believes Stannis is meant for a\n   greater destiny\n   , and Ser\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   , an honest and honorable man uneasy with the shifts in power at Stannis' court.\n  \n\n   Far to the east,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   has hatched the only three\n   \n    dragons\n   \n   in the world. Eventually they will grow into terrifying monsters capable of destroying cities at her command, but for now they are still hatchlings and vulnerable. With her\n   \n\n     khalasar\n    \n\n   gone, Daenerys and her small band of followers must find a way across a\n   \n    forbidding wasteland\n   \n   and find new allies to support her claim to the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   In the distant north, the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   has mounted an expedition beyond the\n   \n    Wall\n   \n   , searching for missing rangers and investigating rumors of\n   \n    wildlings\n   \n   gathering in the mountains. For\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   this will be a rite of passage as he is asked to make difficult choices, for the realm and for himself.\n  \n\n\n    Production\n   \n\n\n   Filming of Season 2 again took place in\n   Northern Ireland\n   , on location and at the Paint Hall studio facility in\n   Belfast\n   . Additional filming, for the\n   \n    Night's Watch\n   \n   storyline, took place in\n   Iceland\n   .\n   Malta\n   was not used for filming in Season 2, with the city of\n   Dubrovnik\n   in\n   Croatia\n   standing in for\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   instead and used for the new location of\n   \n    Qarth\n   \n   .\n   The production considered filming in\n   Spain\n   but ultimately preferred Croatia for budgetary reasons.\n  \n\n\n    Cast\n   \n\n\n\n    Starring cast\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Peter Dinklage\n    \n    as\n    \n     Tyrion Lannister\n    \n\n     (10 episodes)\n

    "response": "Game of Thrones is not real; it's a fictional story created by author George R.R. Martin. The events, characters, and world described in the series, like the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms, are part of a fantasy universe invented for entertainment.

The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in the War of Conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords is less than two hundred.\n   These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon,\n   Balerion\n   the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance.\n  \n\n   At the end of\n   \n    Robert's Rebellion\n   \n   , during the\n   \n    Sack of King's Landing\n   \n   , as the\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, King\n   \n    Aerys II Targaryen\n   \n   - the Mad King - refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with\n   hidden caches of wildfire\n   . To prevent this, his own\n   \n    Kingsguard\n   \n   Ser\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.\n   Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and Ned Stark came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne, and Eddard made Jaime get off of the Iron Throne. Years later, Jaime's sister Cersei chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting Robert take it, but he did nothing. Stark never knew why Jaime really killed King Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that (apparently, out of arrogance) gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 1\n    \n\n\n\n   Septa\n   \n    Mordane\n   \n   quizzes\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   on her history lessons while walking through the throne room, asking her who built the Iron Throne. Sansa correctly answers that it was Aegon the Conqueror.\n  \n\n   Viserys tells\n   \n    Doreah\n   \n   that the Iron Throne was made of the swords of the vanquished.\n  \n\n   Because the king is out hunting,\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   sits on the Iron Throne while listening to royal petitioners, in his capacity as Hand of the King. He hears a report from a\n   peasant refugee\n   that Ser\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   has been raiding villages in the Riverlands.\n  \n\n   Following the death of King\n   \n    Robert Baratheon\n   \n   , his alleged son\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   takes his place on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n   Far away on the eastern continent in\n   \n    Vaes Dothrak\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   urges her husband Khal\n   \n    Drogo\n   \n   to help her win back the Iron Throne that her own father once sat upon, for her and Drogo's unborn son that she carries inside her. At first, Drogo is not very interested: Westeros is very far away, across the ocean, and to the\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   it seems just like a literal chair (without all of the connotations of authority over the Seven Kingdoms associated with it). After a failed assassination attempt on Daenerys by one of Robert's agents, however, Drogo is deeply offended, and vows to attack Westeros and take the Iron Throne for Daenerys and their son,\n   \n    Rhaego\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 2\n    \n\n\n\n   Joffrey continues to jauntily sit on the Iron Throne as the\n   \n    War of the Five Kings\n   \n   tears apart the realm. He gets up from the throne to menace the captive\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   with a crossbow, idly considering shooting her, before relenting that his mother insists she remain alive - so he simply orders his Kingsguard to beat and strip her in front of the entire court.\n   Meanwhile, at\n   \n    Dragonstone Island\n   \n   to the east, Robert's younger brother\n   \n    Stannis Baratheon\n   \n   declares that the Iron Throne is his by right, and all who deny that are his foes.\n  \n\n   During the\n   \n    Battle of the Blackwater\n   \n   , just as the battle seems to be turning against the city's defenders, Cersei Lannister goes to the throne room to sit on the Iron Throne herself, while holding her younger son\n   \n    Tommen\n   \n   sitting on her lap. Together they await what she fears will be their end, and gets ready to give\n   Essence of Nightshade\n   to Tommen and herself to painlessly kill them both - as if Stannis is victorious he will have them both tortured to death. In the nick of time, however, her father Tywin enters the throne room along with Ser\n   \n    Loras Tyrell\n   \n   : the main Lannister army along with reinforcements from\n   \n    House Tyrell\n   \n   arrived at the last moment and repulsed Stannis's assault, winning the battle\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 3\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Olenna Tyrell\n   \n   , in typical fashion, has a low opinion of the throne itself, blithely referring to it as \"that ugly iron chair.\"\n  \n\n\n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   remarks to\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   that the Iron Throne doesn't literally have thousands of swords in it, he has counted and the real number is under two hundred. He says that this is another inflated legend, part of the pageantry and propaganda that supports kings and dynasties but which is, in fact, illusory.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 4\n    \n\n\n\n   Following King Joffrey Baratheon's assassination with poison at\n   \n    his own wedding\n   \n   , his younger brother\n   \n    Tommen Baratheon\n   \n   is crowned as the new king in a ceremony while sitting on the Iron Throne.\n   Because Tommen is still underage, however, his grandfather\n   \n    Tywin Lannister\n   \n   , the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, later sits on the Iron Throne while overseeing the\n   court trial of Tyrion Lannister\n   for the (false) charge of poisoning Joffrey.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 6\n    \n\n\n\n   After a new alliance is formed between the crown and the\n   \n    Faith Militant\n   \n   , King Tommen Baratheon dismisses his uncle,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   , from the Kingsguard while sitting on the Iron Throne for marching against the Faith with the\n   \n    Tyrell\n   \n   army. Later in court, King Tommen, from atop the Iron Throne, outlaws\n   \n    trial by combat\n   \n   and announces the date of\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   and Loras' trials. After the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   is\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and the main Tyrell line and the Sparrows are wiped out, King Tommen commits suicide. Without a clear line of succession and anyone to oppose her, Cersei is crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   before the court and sits on the Iron Throne.\n  \n\n\n\n     Season 7\n    \n\n\n\n   Cersei sits on the Iron Throne when she and Jaime negotiate an alliance with\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   , the new self-proclaimed\n   \n    King of the Iron Islands\n   \n   .\n   Later, Euron leads his captives\n   \n    Yara Greyjoy\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Ellaria Sand\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Tyene Sand\n   \n   into the court of Queen Cersei, who sits on the Iron Throne.\n   Cersei alludes to the Iron Throne's original association when she incredulously declares, \"I sit on her father's throne!\" in reference to the very remote possibility of peace with\n   \n    Daenerys Targaryen\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Bran Stark\n   \n   and\n   \n    Samwell Tarly\n   \n   learn that\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   , the alleged bastard of Eddard Stark, is actually the lawful son of\n   \n    Rhaegar Targaryen\n   \n   and\n   \n    Lyanna Stark\n   \n   , born as Aegon Targaryen, As \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Dragonstone\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Season 7\n        \n\n         Episode 1\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Airdate\n     \n\n      July 16, 2017\n     \n\n\n\n      Runtime\n     \n\n      59 minutes\n     \n\n\n\n      Written by\n     \n\n\n       David Benioff\n      \n      &\n      \n       D.B.

Lord Frey has summoned every\n   \n    Frey\n   \n   who took part in the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   under the pretext of revealing his plans. Walder orders the servants to serve them wine from the\n   \n    Arbor\n   \n   but harshly tells his latest wife\n   Kitty Frey\n   that he is not wasting any wine on \"a damn woman\". Walder thanks his family for helping him to slaughter the\n   \n    Starks\n   \n   and backhandedly compliments his brood for the violent deaths of\n   \n    King\n   \n\n    Robb Stark\n   \n   , his wife\n   \n    Talisa Stark\n   \n   , their unborn child, and Lady\n   \n    Catelyn Stark\n   \n   , much to the nervous laughter of his family.\n  \n\n   However, when the Freys begin to choke from poisoned wine, Walder chides them for not killing all the Starks. Walder remarks, \"Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe,\" as his family members die around him. \"Walder\" then reveals himself as a disguised\n   \n    Arya Stark\n   \n   , who has exacted vengeance on those who arranged the massacre of her mother and brother at the\n   \n    Red Wedding\n   \n   . Arya spares Walder's\n   wife\n   and the servants. She tells them, \"The North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\"\n  \n\n   Later, Arya, having acquired a horse, is riding south when she stumbles upon a group of\n   \n    Lannister\n   \n   soldiers who have been sent to the Twins to keep law and order. The soldiers are singing \"Hands of Gold\" and offer to share rabbit meat for dinner. When the soldiers ask why she is riding south, Arya tells them that she is traveling to\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   . Arya learns from the soldiers that the\n   \n    Great Sept of Baelor\n   \n   and its surroundings have been\n   \n    destroyed\n   \n   and that the\n   \n    Red Keep\n   \n   has been essentially sealed. The young soldiers insist that she join them around the campfire to eat and rest. When she asks about their adventures, the soldiers admit that they are homesick and once they left home they wished to return to their families. The young soldier offers her blackberry wine while his brother in arms asks why she is traveling south. Arya tells them that she is going to kill\n   \n    the Queen\n   \n   . Thinking that she is joking, they all burst out laughing. Arya smiles and laughs with them.\n  \n\n   Elsewhere,\n   \n    Sandor Clegane\n   \n   is riding north with the\n   \n    Brotherhood Without Banners\n   \n   , through thick snow. They decide to take shelter for the night at an abandoned home but Sandor, recognizing the house, declares it unsafe.\n   \n    Beric Dondarrion\n   \n   dismisses Sandor's unease and orders that they set up camp for the night. The men enter the house where they discover the corpses of the\n   Farmer\n   and his daughter\n   Sally\n   , whom he and Arya Stark had encountered two years prior following the Red Wedding. It appears that the father killed his daughter and himself so that they would not starve to death.\n  \n\n   Sandor recalls seeing Beric at the tournament at\n   \n    King's Landing\n   \n   , and wonders aloud why Beric keeps getting resurrected, as there's nothing special about him. Beric confides that he does not know what\n   \n    R'hllor\n   \n   , the Lord of Light, is telling him. Sandor remarks that he does not believe in divine justice, citing the fate of the farmer and his daughter. Despite Sandor's fear of flames, Thoros tells him to look into the fire. He tells him that only the fire can show him what the Lord of Light wants him to see. At first, Sandor can only see burning logs, but then, to his own shock, he sees a\n   \n    Wall of Ice\n   \n   . He also sees a\n   \n    castle where the Wall meets the sea\n   \n   , a mountain that looks like an arrowhead, and thousands of the\n   \n    dead\n   \n   marching past. Beric asks Sandor if he now believes that they are here for a reason.\n  \n\n   Later,\n   \n    Thoros\n   \n   finds Sandor burying the dead farmer and his daughter Sally in the snow. Thoros deduces that Sandor knew the dead, but Sandor admits that he doesn't. The two of them bury the bodies together, and Sandor attempts to deliver an epitaph to\n   the Seven\n   , but can't remember the rest of the verse. Instead, he simply tells the dead that they deserve better.\n  \n\n\n    At Winterfell\n   \n\n\n   At\n   \n    Winterfell\n   \n   , the\n   \n    King in the North\n   \n\n    Jon Snow\n   \n   organizes the defense of the North against the Night King and his army of the dead. He asks that all maesters start searching for\n   \n    dragonglass\n   \n   , stressing it is now more valuable than gold due to its effectiveness against the White Walkers. Jon also requests that Tormund and his people man Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as Tormund and the other wildlings were present at Hardhome and have seen the Night King and Tormund agrees to defend this castle. Jon orders for all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 in his kingdom to be trained in combat in order to defend against the encroaching threat of the White Walkers. Because having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough, he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. When\n   Robett Glover\n   balks at the idea of arming his young granddaughter,\n   \n    Lady\n   \n\n    Lyanna Mormont\n   \n   remarks that she certainly will not remain idle and volunteers to help, giving her assurance that every girl on\n   \n    Bear Island\n   \n   will be trained alongside the boys. The words of the young lady once more remind the older lords of their place and they agree.\n  \n\n   The next order of business is the possibility of the Walkers getting past the wall; if they do, Jon notes that the first obstacles they encounter will be the castles of\n   \n    Last Hearth\n   \n   and\n   Karhold\n   , the seats belonging to the two Northern houses that fought alongside the Boltons. Lord\n   \n    Yohn Royce\n   \n   opines that the castles should be demolished for their lords' treachery, but\n   \n    Sansa Stark\n   \n   interjects that Last Hearth and Karhold committed no crimes and urges her half-brother to instead strip the\n   \n    Umbers\n   \n   and\n   \n    Karstarks\n   \n   of their castles as punishment for turning against the Starks. However, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and she reluctantly obliges. Jon then summons\n   Ned Umber\n   and\n   Alys Karstark\n   - both of whom are children who obviously played no part in their father's betrayal and are clearly terrified of what will happen to them. He asks them to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore.\n   \n    Petyr Baelish\n   \n   watches the proceedings with a smile.\n  \n\n   In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies. He tells Sansa that while she is his sister and she can question his decisions, doing so when he is publicly addressing the Northern lords and ladies undermines his position with them. When Sansa responds that the late\n   \n    Joffrey Baratheon\n   \n   did not tolerate dissent, Jon reassures her that h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     The Dragon and the Wolf\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         Season 7\n        \n\n         Episode 7\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Airdate\n     \n\n      August 27, 2017\n     \n\n\n\n      Runtime\n     \n\n      80 minutes\n     \n\n\n\n      Written by\n     \n\n\n       David Benioff\n      \n      &\n      \n       D.B.

On the walls,\n   \n    Jaime Lannister\n   \n   and\n   \n    Bronn\n   \n   discuss how the latter is unnerved by the idea of soldiers without genitalia, as he's been around enough soldiers to know why they fight, and that the idea of soldiers who fight for no promise of sex is alien to him. As they talk, hordes of\n   \n    Dothraki\n   \n   ride in, a stark contrast to the disciplined Unsullied who don't even blink as hundreds of horses flood past them; but the two ancient enemies are united in cause today.\n  \n\n   At the harbor,\n   \n    Tyrion Lannister\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Varys\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Missandei\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Jon Snow\n   \n   and\n   \n    Davos Seaworth\n   \n   nervously sail past\n   \n    Euron Greyjoy\n   \n   's fleet.\n   \n    Sandor Clegane\n   \n   goes below decks to check on their \"guest,\" who is thankfully just as riled up as ever. In her solar,\n   \n    Cersei\n   \n   is informed by\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   of the arrival of Daenerys's party, though there is no sign of Daenerys herself. Cersei promptly tells\n   \n    Gregor Clegane\n   \n   that if anything goes wrong at the summit, he is to kill Daenerys, Tyrion and Jon in that order, then dispose of the rest as he pleases.\n  \n\n   The group arrives and are escorted to the\n   Dragonpit\n   , the location of the summit. Tyrion reconnects with Bronn, who concedes it is good to see him again. The pair greet\n   \n    Podrick Payne\n   \n   , who had arrived earlier with\n   \n    Brienne of Tarth\n   \n   . As Pod goes off with Bronn, Brienne hangs back to talk with Sandor. They both acknowledge that they only fought to protect Arya, and she tells him that Arya doesn't need looking out for anymore; rather, he should reserve his concern for whoever is unfortunate or stupid enough to stand in her way, which seems to amuse him.\n  \n\n   At the Dragonpit, the various factions meet:\n   \n    Cersei Lannister\n   \n   , Jaime,\n   \n    Qyburn\n   \n   and\n   \n    Euron\n   \n   representing the Iron Throne, Jon, Davos and Brienne representing the North, and\n   \n    Daenerys\n   \n   's court. When Cersei demands to know where her rival is, the\n   \n    Dragon\n   \n   Queen makes a suitably dramatic entrance on\n   \n    Drogon\n   \n   's back, with\n   \n    Rhaegal\n   \n   flying overhead. Sandor, for the first time in years, comes face-to-helmet with his brother\n   \n    Gregor\n   \n   , and wonders what exactly has happened to him, before leaving to retrieve the\n   captured wight\n   . Sandor ultimately muses however that what happened to Gregor is irrelevant, and promises what's left of his brother that he still intends to end Gregor. Euron tries to posture, threatening to kill\n   \n    Yara\n   \n   unless\n   \n    Theon\n   \n   yields to him and deriding Tyrion's dwarfism; when Tyrion and Theon retort to his taunts with their own, Euron remarks that Tyrion would have been killed at birth in the\n   \n    Iron Islands\n   \n   . A furious Jaime orders Euron to sit down, and when he disregards the warning, Cersei repeats it; a subdued Euron returns to his seat.\n  \n\n   Getting the meeting on track, Tyrion and Jon attempt to convince the Lannister queen of the\n   \n    greater threat\n   \n   coming from the North for them all; according to Tyrion, one million people all live crammed together in the city. They will soon become one million more soldiers in the army of the dead. Cersei callously responds that it will likely be an improvement for most of them, her flippancy noticeably angering the normally stoic Jon. Cersei refuses to believe the claims, dismissing them as a ploy to trick her into lowering her defenses. To prove their claims, Sandor returns with the crate containing the wight, which is uncharacteristically silent. Sandor gets the crate open and is visibly frightened by what he sees inside it, which worries Jaime since he knows the Hound is not afraid of anything. Cersei watches the proceedings with a dismissively smug smirk. Sandor finally gives the crate a massive kick and knocks it over; the enraged wight promptly clambers out and charges toward the nearest target - Cersei, appropriately enough. Completely stunned at the sight of the undead creature throwing itself towards them, the Lannister queen and her allies recoil in horror as Sandor pulls the screeching monster back on a chain, its claws inches from Cersei's face, and manages to slice the creature in half when it turns to attack him. The Stark and Targaryen delegations watch it emotionlessly but the Lannisters look on in shock as the wight's upper half continues to move, shrieking and snarling, trying to crawl towards Sandor, who slices off one of its outstretched hands. After a clearly fascinated Qyburn briefly examines it, Jon steps forward and takes the wight's severed hand, using a torch provided by Davos to demonstrate how fire can be used to stop them. He then uses a\n   \n    dragonglass\n   \n   dagger to kill the wight's upper half, bluntly stating that if they don't win the coming war, such a fate awaits every person in\n   \n    Westeros\n   \n   , insisting that all their other conflicts pale in comparison to the\n   \n    Great War\n   \n   . Daenerys, who has watched the whole thing poker-faced, states that she didn't believe it herself until she saw them all personally. A horror-struck Jaime asks how many wights are coming, and Daenerys tells him the\n   \n    army of the dead\n   \n   numbers at least 100,000. Euron asks if the wights can swim. When Jon responds, \"No,\" Euron announces to Cersei his intention to withdraw his fleet back to the Iron Isles. He declares that he has been over the whole world and has never been terrified until now. On his way out, he tells Daenerys to retreat to her own\n   \n    island\n   \n   and to come find him when they are the only two left alive.\n  \n\n   Seemingly convinced, Cersei immediately offers terms: satisfied that Daenerys is concerned with the army of the dead, Cersei will not withdraw her troops, but will guarantee that they will not hinder the\n   \n    Targaryen\n   \n   or\n   \n    Northern\n   \n   forces in any way during the battle against the\n   \n    White Walkers\n   \n   . She refuses to deal with Daenerys at all, however, and calls on Jon Snow, as\n   \n    King in the North\n   \n   and\n   \n    Eddard Stark\n   \n   's son, to keep the truce and to stay out of any future conflict between Cersei and Daenerys. Jon, however, says that he cannot serve two queens - and reveals to all assembled that he has already declared for Daenerys, infuriating all three\n   \n    Lannisters\n   \n   present. Declaring that there will be no truce if it is just her and Daenerys, Cersei storms out, content to let the\n   \n    Starks\n   \n   and Targaryens battle the undead alone and then deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict. Desperate, Brienne grabs Jaime and begs him to reconsider, as what they've seen goes beyond such petty reasons as\n   \n    Houses\n   \n   , honor and\n   \n    thrones\n   \n   . Jaime doesn't disagree, but walks away, not knowing what he can say to convince his sister.\n  \n\n   Meanwhile, Daenerys and Tyrion (who never knew about Jon's change of heart in the first place) criticize Jon over declaring his allegiance in public. Tyrion suggests that learning to lie just a little might be a good skill, while Daenerys points out that if they leave without an alliance, everythi",
